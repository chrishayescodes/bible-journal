# Fascism Is Just Plain Dictatorship: How Academia Fell for a Thug's Marketing Campaign

## The Core Tenets of Fascism

Fascism is characterized by several core tenets:

1. **Ultranationalism** - Extreme devotion to one's nation, often with claims of national superiority and destiny

2. **Authoritarian leadership** - Centralized autocratic power, typically under a dictatorial leader with a cult of personality

3. **Forcible suppression of opposition** - Elimination of political rivals, free press, and dissent through violence and intimidation

4. **Rejection of democracy and liberalism** - Opposition to parliamentary democracy, individual rights, and political pluralism

5. **Corporatism** - State control over the economy through partnerships with business elites while maintaining private property

6. **Militarism and expansionism** - Glorification of war, military strength, and territorial conquest

7. **Social hierarchy** - Belief in natural inequality between groups, often based on race, ethnicity, or nationality

8. **Palingenetic myth** - Promise of national rebirth from a period of decline, often invoking a mythical golden age

9. **Anti-intellectualism** - Hostility toward reason, expertise, and critical thinking in favor of emotion and action

10. **Scapegoating** - Blaming minority groups or "enemies" for societal problems to unify the majority

These elements combine to create totalitarian movements that subordinate individual rights to state power and national glory.

### Key Observation
These leaders, spanning over 2,000 years, employed remarkably similar tactics:
- Concentration of power through violence
- Creation of enemy groups to unify supporters
- Use of spectacle and propaganda
- Suppression of intellectual opposition
- Claims of national/cultural superiority
- Militaristic expansion or aggression

The fact that these patterns appear consistently across cultures, centuries, and ideologies supports the argument that "fascism" is simply a modern label for ancient authoritarian behaviors rather than a unique 20th-century phenomenon.

## Academic Recognition of Historical Fascism

Numerous academics have recognized these historical parallels:

### Ancient Rome Comparisons
- **Robert Paxton** noted parallels between Caesar's populist dictatorship and fascist movements
- **Mary Beard** has written about how Mussolini explicitly modeled himself on Augustus
- **Sheldon Wolin** coined "inverted totalitarianism" linking Roman imperial practices to modern authoritarianism

### Napoleon as Proto-Fascist
- **J.L. Talmon** argued Napoleon pioneered "totalitarian democracy"
- **George Mosse** traced fascist political symbolism back to Napoleonic mass spectacles
- **Roger Griffin** identified Napoleon's blend of revolutionary rhetoric and authoritarian rule as proto-fascist

### Pre-20th Century "Fascisms"
- **Zeev Sternhell** controversially argued fascist ideology emerged in 1880s France
- **Robert O. Paxton's** "Five Stages of Fascism" applies his framework to earlier movements
- **Stanley Payne's** "Fascism: Comparison and Definition" explicitly compares fascism to earlier authoritarian systems

### The Academic Debate
Some scholars (like Roger Griffin) insist fascism is uniquely modern, requiring mass politics and specific ideological elements only possible after 1918. Others (like Sternhell) see fascist tendencies throughout history.

This debate actually reinforces the critique that "fascism" may be more about academic categorization than identifying distinct political phenomena. The very fact that scholars debate applying "fascism" retroactively suggests these behaviors aren't unique to the 20th century. If academics can't agree whether Caesar or Napoleon were "fascist," the term becomes an analytical tool of questionable precision rather than a description of a unique historical phenomenon.

## What These Leaders Were Called Before "Fascism"

Before Mussolini coined "fascism," academics and political theorists used straightforward descriptive terms:

### Classical Terminology
- **Tyrant/Tyranny** - From Greek "tyrannos," the standard term for illegitimate authoritarian rule
- **Despot/Despotism** - Absolute ruler with unlimited power
- **Autocrat/Autocracy** - Self-derived power, rule by one
- **Dictator** - Originally a legitimate Roman emergency position, later meaning absolute ruler

### Enlightenment-Era Terms
- **Absolute Monarchy** - Unlimited royal power (Louis XIV, Peter the Great)
- **Oriental Despotism** - European term for Asian authoritarian systems
- **Caesarism** - Military dictatorship with popular support (coined for Napoleon)
- **Bonapartism** - Authoritarian rule through plebiscites and nationalism

### 19th-Century Additions
- **Totalitarianism** - Complete state control (though popularized later)
- **Militarism** - Rule by military values and leaders
- **Imperialism** - Aggressive expansion and domination
- **Reaction/Reactionary** - Authoritarian opposition to liberal progress

### The Key Point
These leaders were simply called what they were - tyrants, despots, dictators, or autocrats. Political scientists didn't need a special category because they recognized these as variations of age-old authoritarian rule.

Aristotle's "Politics" already catalogued these government types in 350 BCE. Machiavelli's "The Prince" (1513) analyzed authoritarian tactics without needing a special term. The vocabulary was descriptive and functional, not theoretical and abstract.

Before "fascism," scholars used straightforward terms that described actual power arrangements rather than constructing elaborate theoretical frameworks around one movement's branding choice. The fact that we now retroactively apply "fascism" to these earlier figures shows how unnecessary the term is - we already had perfectly good words for these phenomena.

## The "Bundle of Sticks" Is Not Superior Understanding

How is one man's simple term "bundle of sticks" some superior understanding of simple totalitarianism? It isn't. That's precisely the absurdity.

Mussolini picked "fasces" (bundle of sticks) as a propaganda symbol - a Roman image meant to evoke strength through unity. It was marketing, not political philosophy. Yet academia has spent a century treating this branding exercise as if it revealed some profound new form of government.

### The Circular Logic
1. Mussolini names his thuggery "fascism" after a Roman symbol
2. Academics study his movement and declare "fascism" a unique phenomenon
3. They then define "fascism" by describing... standard authoritarian behaviors
4. When these same behaviors appear elsewhere, they debate whether it's "really" fascism
5. The term becomes simultaneously everything and nothing

### What Actually Happened
- A violent opportunist gave tyranny a new brand name
- Academics, needing to justify their expertise, elevated this brand into theory
- Entire departments now exist to study what is essentially "dictatorship with Italian characteristics"

### The Real Tell
When scholars need terms like "proto-fascist," "para-fascist," "quasi-fascist," or "fascist-adjacent," they're admitting the category doesn't actually work. You don't need such qualifiers for real analytical categories.

Mussolini didn't discover anything. He just gave academics an excuse to treat age-old authoritarianism as something novel. The "bundle of sticks" explains nothing that "tyranny" or "despotism" didn't already cover - it just sounds more sophisticated at conferences.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, fascism is nothing more than it was originally: a fancy term to brand dictatorship.

Mussolini needed a name for his movement. He chose "fascism." Academia took the bait and spent a century intellectualizing what was simply repackaged tyranny. The result is that we now have elaborate theories, entire academic departments, and endless debates about something that requires no special explanation beyond "dictatorship with better marketing."

The bundle of sticks was never philosophy. It was propaganda. And we're still falling for it.
