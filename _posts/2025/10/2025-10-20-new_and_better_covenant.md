# Comprehensive Analysis: Jesus Establishes the New Covenant

## TL;DR: How the New Covenant Supercedes the Old

The new covenant **completely replaces and abolishes** the Old Covenant's system because Christ's sacrifice made it obsolete. The old system was always meant to be temporary—a shadow pointing to Christ. When He came, the entire Mosaic system (sacrifices, priesthood, dietary laws, temple worship) ended because its purpose was fulfilled. The new covenant is superior because: (1) it requires only one perfect sacrifice instead of endless animal sacrifices, (2) it forgives sins permanently rather than temporarily, (3) it transforms hearts internally rather than demanding external obedience, (4) it grants all believers direct access to God rather than through priests, and (5) it offers eternal life instead of temporary material blessings. Christ didn't just improve the old system—He terminated it and established an entirely new relationship with God based on His completed work, not human performance.

## Overview

Jesus Christ establishes a new covenant with God's people that fundamentally transforms the relationship between humanity and God. This new arrangement supersedes the Old Covenant established through Moses at Sinai, yet fulfills the prophetic promises made centuries earlier. The new covenant is ratified through Jesus' blood sacrifice and mediated by His unique person as both God and Man.

## I. THE FOUNDATION: THE OLD COVENANT

### Nature of the Old Covenant

The Old Covenant was established at Mount Sinai through Moses and centered on the Mosaic Law. Its key characteristics included:

**External Focus:** The law was written on stone tablets—external to the people. Obedience was demanded from the outside through commandments and legal requirements.

**Repeated Sacrifices:** Because the people repeatedly failed to keep the covenant, animal sacrifices had to be continuously offered to temporarily atone for sin. Levitical priests performed these rituals daily, creating an endless cycle of sacrifice.

**Limited Forgiveness:** The animal sacrifices provided only temporary, ritual purification of the flesh—not permanent removal of sin or transformation of conscience. God remembered the sins; they were not truly forgiven.

**National Focus:** The covenant was primarily with the nation of Israel, though many individuals within the nation did not know God personally.

**Conditional Nature:** The blessing of the covenant depended on Israel's obedience. When they broke the covenant through persistent disobedience, they faced judgment and exile.

### Limitations Acknowledged in Scripture

Even the Old Testament prophets recognized these limitations. Moses anticipated Israel's failure and predicted a future restoration. Jeremiah explicitly prophesied that a new covenant was coming because the old one had proven insufficient to transform God's people.

## II. THE PROPHECY: JEREMIAH'S VISION OF THE NEW COVENANT

### The Central Prophecy (Jeremiah 31:31-34)

Jeremiah is the only Old Testament prophet to use the specific phrase "new covenant." His prophecy is directly quoted or alluded to throughout the New Testament:

**"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake... But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the LORD: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their hearts will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more."** (KJV)

### Key Differences Prophesied

The new covenant would differ from the old in four fundamental ways:

1. **Internal Transformation:** God would write His law on hearts and minds, not just on stone tablets. Obedience would flow from transformed hearts, not external compulsion.

2. **Universal Knowledge:** "All" God's people—"from the least of them unto the greatest"—would know God personally. This contrasts with the Old Covenant where many in Israel did not know God.

3. **Permanent Forgiveness:** God would remember their sins "no more." This is permanent, complete forgiveness—not the temporary relief offered by animal sacrifices.

4. **Renewed Relationship:** The relational declaration "I will be their God, and they shall be my people" would be restored with new vigor and permanence.

## III. JESUS: THE MEDIATOR OF THE NEW COVENANT

### Jesus as Mediator

The New Testament explicitly identifies Jesus as the mediator of the new covenant. This requires understanding what "mediator" means biblically:

A mediator stands between two parties, representing both. To serve as mediator between God and humanity, Jesus had to possess both the divine nature (to represent God's justice and holiness) and human nature (to represent humanity's needs). Only Jesus uniquely possessed both natures without sin—the only qualification for bringing reconciliation.

As mediator, Jesus did not merely arrange the covenant; He guaranteed its fulfillment through His own sacrifice. He became the surety or guarantor that all covenant terms would be satisfied.

### Key Passages on Jesus as Mediator

**Hebrews 8:6** (KJV): "But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."

**Hebrews 9:15** (KJV): "And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."

**Hebrews 12:24** (KJV): "And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel."

## IV. THE RATIFICATION: JESUS' BLOOD SACRIFICE

### The Mechanics of Covenant Ratification

In ancient practice, covenants were ratified through blood sacrifice. The shedding of blood symbolized the seriousness of the commitment and the transfer of life itself. When God made the first covenant at Sinai, Moses sprinkled the blood of animals on both the people and the covenant documents.

**Exodus 24:8** describes this: "And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words."

The new covenant required a sacrifice of far greater worth than animal blood.

### The Ultimate Sacrifice

**Matthew 26:28** (KJV): "For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."

At the Last Supper, Jesus identified His own blood as the instrument that would ratify the new covenant. This was unprecedented—not the blood of animals, but the blood of the Son of God Himself.

**Key Theological Points:**

**Infinitely Superior Sacrifice:** Because Jesus is God incarnate, His life is worth infinitely more than all human life combined. His single sacrifice accomplished what no amount of animal sacrifices could achieve.

**Once for All:** The new covenant required only one sacrifice, not repeated ones. Jesus' sacrifice was so complete that it needs never be repeated.

**Hebrews 9:12** (KJV): "Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption."

**Hebrews 10:10** (KJV): "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."

## V. THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEW COVENANT

### What the New Covenant Provides

**1. Complete Forgiveness of Sins**

The old covenant could only provide ritual purification. The new covenant provides permanent, complete forgiveness.

**Hebrews 8:12** (KJV): "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."

**Hebrews 10:17** (KJV): "And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."

Unlike the old system where priests continually reminded God of sins through repeated sacrifices, God actively chooses not to remember the sins of those in covenant with Him through Christ.

**2. Inner Transformation Through the Holy Spirit**

The new covenant involves receiving God's Holy Spirit to indwell believers permanently, not just special individuals.

**Hebrews 8:10** (KJV): "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people."

The Spirit writes God's law on hearts, creating internal motivation rather than external compulsion. Believers desire to obey because they are transformed, not because they are forced.

**3. Personal Knowledge of God**

**Hebrews 8:11** (KJV): "And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them."

Every believer has direct access to God through Christ. The old covenant had priests as intermediaries; the new covenant allows all believers to approach God directly.

**4. Eternal Life and Inheritance**

**Hebrews 9:15** (KJV): "And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."

The new covenant promises not temporal blessings (land, food, protection) but eternal life with God.

**5. Justification Before God**

Believers in the new covenant are declared righteous through faith in Christ's sacrifice. This is not based on their own obedience but on Christ's perfect obedience and His blood covering their sins.

## VII. HOW JESUS ESTABLISHES THE COVENANT

### Three Stages of Fulfillment

**1. Inauguration (First Advent)**

Jesus' death and resurrection inaugurated the new covenant. His sacrifice was offered, and through faith in His work, believers enter the covenant relationship immediately.

The Last Supper marks the formal institution: Jesus declared the new covenant "in my blood" and commanded His disciples to remember Him through the covenant meal. His crucifixion ratified it with His blood.

**2. Application (Present Age)**

During this age, the new covenant is being applied to believers individually as they come to faith in Christ. Each person who believes is brought into the covenant benefits: forgiveness, the Holy Spirit, knowledge of God, and eternal life.

However, not all aspects are yet fulfilled. Believers still struggle with sin, still need to grow spiritually, and still await their ultimate transformation.

**3. Consummation (Second Advent)**

When Christ returns, the new covenant will reach its complete fulfillment. At that time:
- All believers will be perfectly transformed (no more sin)
- Universal knowledge of God will be realized
- The entire new covenant promise of Jeremiah will be completely fulfilled

---

## VIII. THE MECHANISM: HOW CHRIST'S WORK ESTABLISHES THE COVENANT

### Redemption from Past Sins

**Hebrews 9:15** emphasizes that Christ's death redeems "the transgressions that were under the first testament." His sacrifice doesn't just apply to future sins but retroactively covers the sins of Old Testament believers who looked forward to His coming.

This is why Old Testament saints could be saved—they believed in the coming Messiah. Christ's sacrifice was effective across all of history.

### Justification: Declared Righteous

When someone enters the new covenant through faith in Christ, God justifies them—declares them righteous. This happens not because they have perfectly kept God's law but because:

1. **Christ fulfilled the law perfectly** on their behalf
2. **Christ paid the penalty for their sins** through His blood
3. **Faith unites believers with Christ**, so His righteousness is credited to them

### Sanctification: Transformed Heart

The Holy Spirit, given at salvation, begins writing God's law on the believer's heart. This is not an external command but an internal transformation. The believer increasingly desires what God desires, not through fear of punishment but through love for God.

### The Completed Work

Unlike the old covenant priests who continually worked, Christ's work is finished. 

**Hebrews 10:11-14** (KJV) contrasts the two:

"Every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God... For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified."

---

## IX. PARTICIPATION IN THE NEW COVENANT

### How One Enters the New Covenant

Unlike the old covenant, which one inherited by birth into Israel, the new covenant requires personal faith response:

**Faith in Christ:** Believing that Jesus is the Son of God, that His blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins, and receiving Him as Lord and Savior.

**Repentance:** Turning from sin and committing to follow Christ, recognizing the Holy Spirit's work of transformation.

### The Covenant Meal: The Lord's Supper

Jesus commanded remembrance of the new covenant through the breaking of bread and drinking of wine:

**1 Corinthians 11:25** (KJV): "After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me."

When believers participate in the Lord's Supper (Communion/Eucharist), they:
- Commemorate Christ's sacrifice
- Renew their commitment to the covenant
- Experience fellowship with God and fellow believers
- Anticipate Christ's return

This mirrors ancient covenant meals where parties ate together to confirm their agreement.

## X. IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION

### The Superiority of the New Covenant

The new covenant is superior in every respect:

- **Better mediator:** Jesus rather than earthly priests
- **Better sacrifice:** Perfect, final, eternally effective
- **Better promises:** Eternal life rather than temporal blessings
- **Better access:** Direct to God through Christ
- **Better transformation:** Internal heart change rather than external compliance
- **Better scope:** Includes all nations, not just Israel

### The Completion of History's Redemptive Plan

From Genesis onward, God's plan has been to restore humanity to relationship with Himself through a covenant. The old covenants were shadows pointing to the new. Jesus Christ is the fulfillment.

Every element of the old system—the priesthood, the sacrifices, the tabernacle—found its purpose in pointing to Christ. When He came, the temporary was fulfilled and gave way to the permanent.

### Living in Light of the New Covenant

For believers today:

- **Assurance:** Your sins are completely forgiven through Christ's blood, remembered no more by God
- **Access:** You have direct relationship with God through the Holy Spirit indwelling you
- **Transformation:** God is actively writing His law on your heart, creating desire for obedience
- **Purpose:** You are part of God's new covenant community, the Church, fulfilling God's redemptive purpose
- **Hope:** You await the final fulfillment when Christ returns and all things are made new

The new covenant established by Jesus is not merely a legal arrangement or a new set of rules. It is the restoration of the deepest relationship for which humanity was created—intimate knowledge of God, complete forgiveness, and eternal communion with our Creator.
