# Ash Wednesday and the Berean Test

The Bereans were called more noble because they did something dangerous — they checked the teaching against the source. Acts 17:11 says they "searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so." They didn't reject authority. They didn't rebel. They verified. And God's own text honors them for it.

That's the standard. So let's apply it.

## The Question

Where is Ash Wednesday in Scripture? Where is Lent? Where is the imposition of ashes on the forehead by a priest as a sacramental act?

The answer is simple: nowhere.

But here's what *is* in Scripture — Jesus speaking directly in Matthew 6:16-18:

> *"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly."*

That's not ambiguous. Jesus says when you engage in spiritual discipline, don't put it on display. Don't disfigure your face. Wash it. Fast in secret. Let it be between you and God.

The institutional church responded by creating an annual tradition of marking your face for public display.

## The Pattern

This is the Pharisee pattern repeated. Take a genuine spiritual concept — repentance, humility before God — and externalize it into a visible ritual controlled by institutional authority. The ashes must be applied by a priest. You must appear at the right place on the right day. The institution mediates the experience. What Jesus described as a private act between the individual and the Father becomes a public performance that signals submission to the organization administering it.

Jesus addressed this directly. The Pharisees disfigured their faces to be seen fasting. He told them — and us — they have their reward. The reward of being seen. The reward of institutional belonging. But not the reward of the Father who sees in secret.

A person walking through their day with ashes on their forehead isn't engaged in a private act of repentance. They are publicly signaling membership in and submission to an institution. Every person who sees them knows they went to a service, received the mark, and are observing a season. That's the opposite of what Jesus instructed. Not adjacent to it. Not a gray area. The opposite.

## The Defense and Its Problem

The institutional defense is always tradition and church authority — "the church has practiced this for centuries." But duration of practice doesn't validate practice. The Pharisees had centuries of tradition behind their system of external righteousness. Jesus wasn't impressed. He called them whitewashed tombs — beautiful on the outside, dead within.

The question was never "how long have we done this?" The question is "does this align with what God actually said?" That's the Berean test. Open the text. Read it. Let it speak for itself without layers of institutional interpretation telling you what it's allowed to mean.

## Power and Access

There's a reason institutional religion resists the Berean model. When individuals go to the source and verify for themselves, the gatekeeper class becomes unnecessary. Every layer of ritual, sacrament, and priestly mediation that inserts itself between the individual and God is a dependency — and dependencies are power.

Christianity, at its foundation, is the most democratized faith in existence. Salvation is a choice offered freely to anyone. No priest required. No ritual required. No institution required. The thief on the cross had nothing — no works, no history, no sacramental record — and one moment of faith was enough.

Every structure that adds requirements to that simplicity is adding itself to the equation. And the question every believer should ask — the Berean question — is whether that addition comes from Scripture or from the institution's need to remain relevant.

## The Simple Test

Open Matthew 6. Read verses 16 through 18. There is no textual ambiguity to resolve. The Greek doesn't soften it. The context doesn't qualify it.

Jesus said wash your face. The institution says mark it.

One of those is Scripture. The other is tradition. The Berean knows which one to follow.
