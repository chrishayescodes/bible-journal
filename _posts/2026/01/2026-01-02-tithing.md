### Tithing in the New Testament Dispensation: A Synthesis

**Tithing is an act of faith, not adherence to law.**

The entire biblical witness confirms this. Every mention of tithing, properly understood, reveals faith as the operative principle—not legal compliance.

### The Pre-Law Foundation

Tithing predates Sinai by centuries. Abraham tithed to Melchizedek spontaneously, responding to divine deliverance with no command requiring it. Jacob knew to tithe because someone taught him—the practice transmitted generationally among believers long before Moses received the Law.

The Law didn't invent tithing. It codified what faith had already been practicing.

### Moral Law, Not Ceremonial

Tithing belongs to the category of moral law—rooted in the unchanging reality of divine ownership—not ceremonial law fulfilled and abolished in Christ.

Ceremonial laws pointed forward to Christ: sacrifices, priesthood, dietary restrictions. They were shadows awaiting substance.

Tithing points upward to God's ownership, which remains constant across all dispensations. God owned everything before Sinai, during Sinai, and after Calvary.

The New Testament didn't abolish moral law. It intensified it.

### Jesus Affirmed It

Matthew 23:23 settles the question directly. Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for neglecting weightier matters—judgment, mercy, faith—while meticulously tithing herbs.

His verdict: "These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."

The weightier matters ought to be done. The tithing ought not be left undone. Both. Not either/or.

If tithing were ceremonial law about to be abolished, Jesus chose an odd moment to affirm it shouldn't be left undone.

### Paul's Moral Precedent

Paul didn't command a percentage, but he anchored ministry support in the Levitical pattern: "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple?... Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel" (1 Corinthians 9:13-14).

"Even so"—by the same principle, the same moral logic.

Paul later expressed regret for not receiving support from the Corinthians, recognizing he had done them a disservice by denying them participation in giving. The Corinthians missed the blessing of sowing because Paul, trying to remove obstacles, inadvertently blocked their faith exercise.

### The New Testament Intensification

The New Testament doesn't reduce the ownership claim—it intensifies it.

The rich young ruler wasn't asked for ten percent. He was asked for everything.

The early church in Acts held all things common. "Neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own."

After full obedience to all commands, Jesus said we remain unprofitable servants who have merely done our duty.

Ten percent isn't the ceiling. It's barely the floor. The person arguing against tithing obligation hasn't begun to grapple with what they actually owe.

### The Faith Test

Tithing tests faith precisely because it demands action before understanding, giving before receiving, trust before seeing.

This is the essence of faith: substance of things hoped for, evidence of things not seen.

The young believer who tithes when it doesn't make financial sense learns God's economy. The one who waits for proof before acting never gets tested, never grows, remains theoretical.

Jacob knew about tithing but inverted it: "If You bless me, then I'll give." He spent 22 years suffering the consequences of conditional faith. Abraham tithed without conditions and became the father of faith.

Do before understand. Give before receive. This is how faith works.

### The Intrinsic Fairness

Ten percent scales perfectly. The widow's tenth costs her the same proportional sacrifice as the billionaire's tenth. Neither is asked to do what the other cannot. Both exercise the same relative trust.

No human system achieves this equity. Flat amounts crush the poor. Progressive percentages introduce endless political negotiation. "Give what you feel" trends toward nothing.

The tithe cuts through all of it. Same percentage. Automatically scaled. Intrinsically fair.

---

### The Open Windows

Malachi's invitation stands: "Prove me now herewith... if I will not open you the windows of heaven."

God invites testing. He promises response to faith-filled giving.

The person who calculates $20.73 on $207.27—precise to the penny, not a cent extra—has chosen their measure. Minimum compliance. No faith risk. No proving God.

The person who gives $22—rounded up, pressed down, shaken together, running over—has chosen a different measure. They want the windows open. They acknowledge the law of sowing and reaping. They position themselves for blessing.

"With the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."

The measure you choose determines the measure returned.

---

### The Jar Principle

Rocks, pebbles, sand, water. The jar fills either way. The question is: with what?

Put the rock in first—tithe first, off the top, before anything else—and everything else arranges around it. The jar holds more than calculation predicted.

Put the rock in last—tithe from what's left over, if anything remains—and there's never room. Small things filled the space. The rock gets squeezed out.

Seek first the kingdom. The tithe is the rock. It goes in first.

### The Summary

Tithing is:

- **Pre-Law in origin** — Abraham and Jacob practiced it by faith
- **Moral in nature** — rooted in divine ownership, not ceremonial shadow
- **Affirmed by Jesus** — "not to leave the other undone"
- **Assumed by Paul** — Levitical support as moral precedent for gospel ministry
- **Intensified in the New Testament** — God owns all, not just ten percent
- **A test of faith** — do before understand, give before receive
- **Intrinsically fair** — same proportional sacrifice for all
- **Connected to blessing** — the windows open to those who prove God
- **The rock in the jar** — first priority, everything else arranges around it

The person who won't tithe hasn't begun the faith journey.

The person who tithes precisely at minimum has done mere duty.

The person who tithes generously—pressed down, shaken together, running over—has positioned themselves under open windows.

The debate was never really about percentage or dispensation.

It was always about faith.

Do you trust God with your money?

The answer shows in the giving, not the theology.
