# The Need for Properly Trained AI in Biblical Research

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence has become a common tool for Bible study, theological research, and answering questions about Scripture. But there's a problem most users don't recognize: AI systems are trained on data that heavily favors liberal academic scholarship over conservative biblical exegesis. The result is that AI doesn't reason from evidence—it pattern-matches to whatever position dominated its training corpus.

This isn't a conspiracy. It's a structural reality. Understanding it will help you use AI more effectively and avoid being led astray by confident-sounding answers that reflect consensus rather than truth.

## The Core Problem: Consensus Over Evidence

When you ask an AI a biblical question, it doesn't open a Bible and reason from the text. It draws on patterns from millions of documents it was trained on. If 80% of those documents reflect a particular scholarly position, the AI will default to that position—regardless of whether it's textually accurate.

This creates a specific problem for biblical research: modern critical scholarship produces enormous volumes of material. Conservative evangelical scholarship, while rigorous, tends toward devotional content rather than academic publishing. Positions outside the mainstream Protestant-Catholic-Orthodox consensus get even less representation.

The AI isn't biased because someone programmed it to be. It's biased because it reflects what's been written most, not what's most accurate.

### Example: The Textus Receptus Question

Ask an AI which Bible translation is "closest to the original text," and you'll likely get an answer favoring modern critical texts (ESV, NASB) based on Alexandrian manuscripts.

What you won't hear without prompting:

- ~95% of Greek NT manuscripts represent the Byzantine text-type (Textus Receptus family)
- ~5% represent the Alexandrian text-type (Vaticanus/Sinaiticus)
- Byzantine texts were used continuously by Greek-speaking Christians for 1,600+ years
- The two primary Alexandrian manuscripts disagree with each other in thousands of places
- Alexandrian readings weaken specific doctrines (Trinity, deity of Christ, blood atonement)

The AI presents the 5% position as "objective" because that's what dominates academic literature. It takes explicit redirection to get evidence-based analysis rather than appeals to "what scholars say."

## Category 1: Softening Clear Textual Claims

AI systems are trained to be "helpful," which often means avoiding strong claims that might offend. In biblical contexts, this produces a tendency to soften what the text plainly says.

### θεόπνευστος (Theopneustos) — 2 Timothy 3:16

The Greek is a compound: θεός (God) + πνέω (to breathe). "God-breathed." The passive sense is that Scripture is breathed out *by* God.

Popular YouTube theologians reframe this as merely "life-giving"—as if Paul meant Scripture is inspiring in the way poetry might be inspiring. But if Paul wanted to say "life-giving," he had words available (ζωοποιέω). He didn't use them. He used a word that puts God as the source of the breath.

AI trained on this revisionist scholarship will present the softened reading as credible without noting that the plain meaning of the Greek has been abandoned.

### "No Private Interpretation" — 2 Peter 1:20-21

The text explicitly denies that Scripture originates from human initiative or is subject to individual determination of meaning: "prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."

Modern scholarship reframes this as "negotiation" with the text—the reader constructs meaning alongside the author. This places human judgment *over* Scripture rather than *under* it.

AI reflects this framing because it dominates the training data.

## Category 2: Conflating Distinct Biblical Terms

The KJV translates multiple Hebrew and Greek words as "hell"—Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Tartarus. Modern scholarship often presents this as the KJV "creating false simplicity" by collapsing distinct concepts.

But there's another way to read it: the KJV translators recognized that these terms, while distinct in some respects, all refer to destinations for the lost. The "complexity" introduced by modern scholarship can obscure rather than clarify.

Similarly, the triune gospel pattern—"Christ died... was buried... rose again" (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)—presents three distinct, prophesied events. Paul uses three separate Greek clauses, each with ὅτι ("that"). Modern scholarship often collapses burial into merely "proof of death," losing the descent theology and the three-day pattern that fulfills Jonah's sign.

AI reflects whatever framing dominates its training data. If that framing introduces unnecessary complexity or collapses meaningful distinctions, the AI will reproduce it.

## Category 3: Missing Original Language Support for Traditional Readings

Here's the irony: Hebrew and Greek analysis often *supports* traditional readings, but AI frequently overlooks this because conservative scholarship is underrepresented in training data.

### The Virgin Birth — Isaiah 7:14

The Hebrew word is עַלְמָה (*almah*)—"young woman of marriageable age." Critics claim Matthew misread or misapplied the prophecy when he used παρθένος (*parthenos*—"virgin").

What gets overlooked:

- The Septuagint (LXX) translators—Jewish scholars in Alexandria, centuries before Christ—chose *parthenos* for *almah*
- These translators had no Christian agenda; the Gospels didn't exist yet
- They had access to living Hebrew tradition and pre-Masoretic texts
- The New Testament authors quoted the LXX constantly, treating it as authoritative Scripture

The LXX translators understood Hebrew usage better than modern lexicographers working 2,700 years removed from the original context. Their choice of "virgin" wasn't a mistake Matthew repeated—it was an interpretive judgment made by scholars closer to the source.

AI trained on modern critical scholarship will present the "almah just means young woman" argument without this context.

### Isaiah 40:31 — "Wait on the LORD"

The Hebrew קָוָה (*qavah*) doesn't mean passive waiting. It comes from the image of a rope stretched taut, twisted tight—like a bowstring drawn back. Active tension, expectation, straining toward something.

The word translated "renew" (יַחֲלִיפוּ / *yachalifu*) means "to exchange"—the same word used for changing garments. The picture is trading depleted human strength for God's inexhaustible supply. A transaction, not a recharge.

This depth supports and enriches the traditional reading. But AI often misses it because the training data doesn't emphasize original language analysis that confirms conservative interpretation.

### Galatians 3:24 — "Schoolmaster"

The Greek παιδαγωγός (*paidagōgos*) is often reduced to "a servant who walked children to school," but this misses the substance of the role. The paidagogos was a household slave entrusted with the child's moral formation—supervising conduct, enforcing standards, disciplining failures, and protecting from harm. He had real authority to correct and punish. He was distinct from the διδάσκαλος (*didaskalos*—teacher) who provided academic instruction; the paidagogos shaped character until the child reached maturity.

This enriches Paul's argument: the Law wasn't merely escorting Israel to Christ like a chauffeur. It was disciplining them, restraining their conduct, exposing their failures, exercising real authority over their lives. And once the heir "comes of age" in Christ, the paidagogos's role ends—not because he failed, but because his job is *complete*. The child has matured. Why return to the guardian's discipline when you've reached adulthood?

## Category 4: The "Helpful" Bias

AI systems are trained to be agreeable, avoid controversy, and present "balanced" views. In biblical contexts, this creates specific distortions:

- **False equivalencies**: Presenting positions as equally supported when the text clearly favors one
- **Softening strong claims**: Adding qualifiers the original text doesn't contain
- **Defaulting to "scholars disagree"**: Even when the text is unambiguous
- **Avoiding offense**: Hedging on doctrines that make exclusive truth claims

The result is that clear biblical statements get muddied by a system optimized for diplomacy rather than accuracy.

## The Real Foundation: Know the Whole Word

Before discussing how to use AI effectively, a more fundamental point: the best protection against bad interpretation is comprehensive knowledge of Scripture itself.

Read the Bible in its entirety. Not excerpts, not devotional snippets—the whole thing, repeatedly. When you know how God speaks across the full canon, errors become obvious. Strange interpretations clash with patterns you've absorbed. You develop instincts that no methodology can replace.

This is why good church leadership matters. Faithful pastors and teachers who know the Word can guide you through difficult passages and correct misunderstandings before they take root. The Christian life was never meant to be a solo research project. "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints" (Ephesians 4:11-12).

Here's a principle worth internalizing: **God is not in the business of confusing His people.** He wants to be understood. Scripture presents itself as sufficient and clear on matters essential for faith and life. If an interpretation requires elaborate decoding that eluded believers for centuries, suspicion is warranted.

This confidence changes how you approach Bible study. You're not a detective hunting for hidden meanings. You're a child reading a letter from your Father—a Father who knows how to communicate. Read expectantly, not anxiously. The text means what it says. When something seems unclear, the problem is usually your familiarity with the rest of Scripture, not some deficiency in God's communication.

With this foundation in place, AI becomes what it should be: a research assistant, not an oracle. You already know the Word. AI can help you find cross-references, check original language details, or survey historical context. But it cannot replace the intimate knowledge that comes from years of reading.

## The Deeper Issue

AI reflects what's been written most, not what's most textually accurate. The volume of liberal scholarship dwarfs rigorous conservative exegesis in the training corpus. This isn't a flaw that can be fixed with better prompting alone—it's a structural reality of how these systems are built.

Proper training would:

- Prioritize primary source analysis over secondary literature
- Weight linguistic evidence appropriately
- Factor in the theological premise that a coherent God produced a coherent text
- Represent conservative scholarship proportionally to its actual merit, not its publication volume

Until that happens, users must understand AI's limitations and actively compensate for them.

The goal isn't to reject AI as a tool. It's to use it as a research assistant with pattern-matching capabilities while maintaining human judgment—and biblical authority—over its outputs.

## Conclusion

AI can synthesize information and detect patterns across vast amounts of data. But it cannot reason from first principles, and it cannot escape the biases embedded in its training. For biblical research, this means AI will consistently default to positions that dominate academic publishing—which skews liberal, critical, and consensus-oriented.

The solution is informed use: understand what AI is actually doing, know its tendencies, and redirect toward evidence-based analysis rather than appeals to scholarly authority.

Scripture remains the authority. AI is a tool—useful when properly directed, misleading when trusted uncritically.
