**They That Love the Law of the Lord**

"Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them." — Psalm 119:165

This verse gets quoted often, sometimes as encouragement, sometimes as a weapon. The encouragement reading: if you're rooted in God's word, you'll have stability that circumstances can't shake. The weapon reading: if you're offended, you must not be rooted enough—the problem is you.

But what does the verse actually claim? And what is this "offense" that the law-lover avoids?

**The Stumbling Block**

The Hebrew word translated "offend" is *mikshol*—a stumbling block, an obstacle that causes falling. The Greek Old Testament renders it with *skandalon*, the trigger-stick of a trap. Before this word ever meant hurt feelings, it meant something that takes you down.

Our English word "scandal" descends directly from *skandalon*, but the meaning shifted over time. In modern usage, "scandalous" primarily means shocking to public morals—something that causes outrage or damages reputation. The focus moved to the reaction of observers, the social fallout.

The Greek kept the focus on the mechanism and its effect on the person who encounters it. A skandalon isn't primarily something that shocks onlookers—it's something that takes down the one who hits it. The crowd's reaction is irrelevant. What matters is whether you're still standing.

But here's the nuance: the two senses often work together. The skandalon shocks *and* trips. The shock is frequently *how* it trips. Revulsion creates the stumbling condition. The thing that is scandalous in the shocking sense becomes scandalous in the falling sense—people can't get past the offense to reach the meaning underneath.

So the psalm isn't promising that rooted believers won't experience emotional discomfort. It's promising they won't be *tripped up*. They won't hit an obstacle that sends them sprawling off the path. Their love for Torah creates stability deep enough to keep them upright when the ground shifts—even when what they encounter is shocking.

This changes the question. It's not "why are you upset?"—it's "what would it take to knock you down?"

**The Traps That Took People Down**

The New Testament is littered with casualties—people who hit a skandalon and went down. The examples reveal what kinds of obstacles trip people up.

*The Rich Young Ruler* came to Jesus with genuine interest: "What good thing shall I do to have eternal life?" He'd kept the commandments from youth. But when Jesus said to sell everything and follow him, "he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions" (Matthew 19:16-22). His wealth was the trigger that sprung the trap. He hit an obstacle he couldn't get past and walked away. A casualty.

*The crowd at Capernaum* had just experienced the multiplication of fishes and loaves. Five thousand fed from a boy's lunch. They were so impressed they wanted to make Jesus king by force (John 6:15). The next day they tracked him down, hungry for more.

Jesus confronted their motivation: "You seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled" (John 6:26). Then he pivoted to harder teaching. He was the bread of life. His flesh was real food. His blood was real drink. "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you" (John 6:53).

For Jewish listeners, this was viscerally repulsive. Levitical law prohibited consuming blood. The language wasn't just confusing—it was stomach-turning. Many responded: "This is a hard saying; who can hear it?" Jesus asked directly: "Does this offend you?" (John 6:60-61).

Many walked away and followed him no more. The day before, they wanted to crown him. Now they couldn't leave fast enough.

Here the shock functioned as the mechanism of stumbling. They couldn't get past the revulsion of the words to reach the meaning underneath. The grotesque imagery became the trigger-stick they stepped on. They were scandalized in both senses—shocked and tripped—and the two weren't separate events. The shock was how they fell.

The fishes and loaves crowd became casualties of flesh and blood teaching.

*Nazareth* heard Jesus teach and saw his works, but couldn't reconcile this with the carpenter's son they knew. "And they were offended in him" (Matthew 13:57). Familiarity became the trap. They stumbled over his ordinariness and he could do no mighty work there.

*The Pharisees* heard Jesus teach that defilement comes from within, not from unwashed hands. The disciples reported: "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?" (Matthew 15:12). Their tradition became the skandalon. Jesus threatened their system and they couldn't accept a messiah who didn't validate their additions to Torah.

Even *John the Baptist* faced potential stumbling. From prison, he sent disciples to ask: "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?" Jesus responded with evidence of his ministry, then added: "Blessed is he who is not offended in me" (Matthew 11:2-6). The messiah John announced wasn't delivering expected results—John was still in prison. Jesus gently warned against letting unmet expectations become a trap.

The pattern emerges: wealth, hard teaching, familiarity, tradition, unmet expectations. Each became a skandalon for someone. Each produced casualties.

**What Tripped Up Israel**

Jesus used this same framework to describe what happened to shallow believers. In Mark 4:17, the rocky-ground hearers receive the word with joy, but when tribulation comes because of it, "immediately they are offended"—*skandalizontai*. They hit a trap and went down. No roots, no stability, no survival.

These were Jewish listeners with messianic expectations. They weren't rejecting the idea of messiah—they were excited about it. But *this* messiah, one who brought persecution instead of political victory, who promised his followers suffering rather than thrones—that was the skandalon. The tribulation wasn't incidental. It was evidence that Jesus wasn't delivering what they expected.

They stumbled because their love for the law was partial. They loved the parts about a conquering king. They hadn't absorbed Isaiah 53 or Deuteronomy 21. When the suffering servant showed up, they had no framework to hold them upright.

Peter demonstrated this even in the inner circle. When Jesus announced his coming suffering and death, Peter rebuked him: "This shall not be unto thee." Jesus responded: "Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art a skandalon unto me" (Matthew 16:21-23). Peter himself became the trap. His messianic expectations—no suffering, no death—positioned him as an obstacle in Jesus' path. The same misunderstanding that would trip up Israel was already operating among the twelve.

**The Rock of Offense**

Here the irony sharpens. Jesus himself is called a "stone of stumbling" and "rock of skandalon" (Romans 9:33, 1 Peter 2:8). The messiah became the trap for those who rejected him. They stumbled over him because he didn't fit their template.

Paul states it plainly: "We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a skandalon" (1 Corinthians 1:23). The cross isn't an unfortunate stumbling point to be apologized for—it's the central scandal that divides those who believe from those who fall away. The entire gospel is an obstacle to those expecting a different kind of messiah.

And like the teaching at Capernaum, the cross was shocking in ways that made it function as a trap. A crucified messiah wasn't just theologically inconvenient—it was disgusting. Deuteronomy 21:23 declared anyone hung on a tree cursed by God. The cross was shameful, degrading, reserved for the lowest criminals. The shock of a cursed messiah *was* the stumbling block. Jewish listeners couldn't get past the revulsion to see the redemption.

So the person who loves the *whole* law—including the parts that point to a suffering redeemer—won't be scandalized when he arrives. The law itself prepared them. But selective love for Torah, love that edits out the uncomfortable parts, creates the very conditions for stumbling.

Psalm 119:165 starts to read differently. The one who loves God's law completely has great peace. Nothing becomes a skandalon for them—not even a crucified messiah, not even hard teaching about flesh and blood. But the one who loves selectively has left gaps in their foundation, and those gaps are exactly where they'll trip.

**Casualties**

What unifies every use of skandalon is the falling. Whether the trap is set deliberately or simply exists in the path, whether the one who falls bears blame or the one who placed the trap—the result is the same. People go down. Skandalon produces casualties.

Mark 4 is full of them. The rocky-ground hearers who fell away. The thorny-ground hearers who got choked out. Only the good soil produced lasting fruit. The others became casualties of various skandala—persecution, cares, riches, desires. The rich young ruler. The crowd at Capernaum. Nazareth. The Pharisees. Each one hit something they couldn't get past.

**Who Sets the Traps**

But here the New Testament introduces a sobering wrinkle. Sometimes casualties result from their own shallowness. Sometimes they result from traps that others set.

Matthew 18:6: "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble—it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."

Jesus doesn't tell the little ones to toughen up. He threatens the trap-setter with a fate worse than drowning. The weight of accountability falls on the one who creates the stumbling condition, especially when the vulnerable are involved.

Matthew 18:7 extends it: "Woe to the world because of skandala! It is necessary that skandala come, but woe to that person through whom the skandalon comes." Traps exist. People fall. But the one who places the trap still bears the woe.

Paul understood this weight. He warned believers not to let their liberty become "a stumbling block to them that are weak" (1 Corinthians 8:9). The knowledgeable believer who flaunts freedom without regard for weaker brothers sets a trap. If the weak brother falls, the one with knowledge bears responsibility. "When you sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ" (1 Corinthians 8:12).

The skandalon can be set carelessly, not just maliciously. That doesn't reduce the accountability.

**The Weaponized Verse**

This is where Psalm 119:165 gets misused. Some leaders quote it after being harsh: "If you really loved God's word, you wouldn't be offended." The verse becomes a shield—any pushback proves the other person's spiritual deficiency rather than prompting self-examination.

But this inverts the New Testament's weight of accountability. Jesus places the heavier burden on the one who *causes* stumbling, not on the one who stumbles. The psalm describes the stability of a rooted believer; it doesn't give leaders license to wound people and blame them for bleeding.

First Timothy 5:19-20 establishes that accusations against elders require multiple witnesses—but also that elders who sin face public rebuke. Protection exists within an accountability structure. Leaders who invoke the protection while ignoring the accountability have handled the text selectively. They've loved part of the law.

**The Full Law**

Scripture takes grievances seriously. Matthew 18:15-17 provides a process for addressing them. Matthew 5:23-24 tells the offending party to leave their offering at the altar and go reconcile. James 5:4 says wages kept back from laborers cry out to God. He hears grievances. He doesn't dismiss them.

The person who loves the *whole* law loves these parts too. They don't just love the verses about their own stability—they love the verses about their responsibility to others. They don't set traps and call it ministry. They don't wound and then quote psalms at the wounded.

Great peace have they which love the law of the Lord. All of it. Including the parts about millstones.
