# Attitude Determines Altitude: A Study in Receptivity

The Gospels present a striking pattern: the same Jesus, the same message, the same power—yet vastly different outcomes depending on who stands before him. What separates those who receive from those who don't? Not circumstance. Not ethnicity. Not even the severity of need. The determining factor is receptivity.

## The Framework: Soil Determines Harvest

Jesus establishes the principle in Mark 4 with the parable of the sower. A farmer scatters seed across different types of ground. The seed is identical throughout. The variable is the soil.

The path-hardened ground never lets the word penetrate. Rocky soil produces enthusiasm without root structure—quick growth that withers under pressure. Thorny ground allows competing priorities to choke whatever begins to grow. Good soil receives, retains, and produces fruit in varying measures.

When the disciples ask why he teaches in parables, Jesus quotes Isaiah: "seeing they may see and not perceive; hearing they may hear and not understand; lest they should be converted and their sins forgiven." This isn't divine sabotage. The quotation describes the result of pre-existing heart condition, not the cause. Isaiah wasn't blinding Israel; he was announcing judgment on a nation already determined not to see.

The disciples demonstrate receptive soil by asking for explanation. The "outsiders" remain outside not because information is withheld but because they don't pursue understanding.

## Exemplary Faith: Outsiders Who Understood

Two Gentiles stand out for faith Jesus says he hasn't found in Israel.

A Syrophoenician woman approaches Jesus on behalf of her demon-possessed daughter. Jesus responds with apparent rejection: "Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."

She doesn't argue against the hierarchy. She works within it: "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs under the table eat from the children's crumbs."

Her logic: even scraps from Israel's table would be sufficient. She persisted through apparent rejection, accepted a humble position, and trusted that the overflow of Jesus' power was enough. Jesus calls this "great faith."

A Roman centurion asks Jesus to heal his servant but stops him from coming to his house: "Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed."

His reasoning comes from his own experience: "I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes."

He understood that authority doesn't require physical presence. If he could command at a distance through delegated power, how much more could Jesus. "I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel."

Both grasped what Israel missed: Jesus' power wasn't limited by proximity, status, or ethnic boundary. Both approached with humility about their position yet confidence in his ability.

## Honest Struggle: Faith and Doubt Coexisting

Mark 9 presents a father whose son is possessed by a spirit that throws him into fire and water. The disciples had already failed to help. When Jesus tells him that all things are possible to those who believe, the father responds with remarkable honesty:

"Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!"

He doesn't pretend to have faith he lacks. He doesn't let his doubt disqualify him from approaching. He names the tension—genuine belief alongside genuine struggle—and asks Jesus to address the very obstacle that might seem to disqualify him.

Jesus heals the boy. The object of faith matters more than its quantity. The cry for help was itself an act of faith.

This models how doubt and faith coexist in actual human experience: approaching Jesus with the struggle rather than waiting until the struggle resolves.

## Trapped in Wrong Frameworks: The Man at Bethesda

John 5 presents a man who had been ill for thirty-eight years, lying by a pool believed to have healing properties when its waters stirred.

Jesus asks a direct question: "Do you want to be made well?"

The man doesn't answer. Instead, he explains why healing is impossible: "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me."

Thirty-eight years of learned helplessness. His identity had become "the man who can't get to the water in time." The obstacle had become the defining reality.

He was devoted to a system that had never worked for him. The pool had failed him for nearly four decades, yet he remained fixated on it as the only path to healing. The solution was asking him the question, and he responded by explaining why the old solution couldn't work.

Unlike the centurion, the Syrophoenician woman, or even "help my unbelief," this man offers no faith statement at all. Jesus heals him anyway—sovereign grace, not response to faith—but the contrast is instructive.

The father with the demon-possessed boy admitted his struggle and asked for help with it. The man at Bethesda doesn't recognize he's trapped in a framework. He's not wrestling with doubt. He's not even aware there's something beyond the pool to believe in.

## Partial Perception: Men Like Trees Walking

Mark 8 records the only healing in the Gospels that happens in stages. Jesus leads a blind man outside Bethsaida, spits on his eyes, and lays hands on him.

"Do you see anything?"

"I see men like trees, walking."

Jesus lays hands on him again. Full sight is restored.

Jesus didn't lack power—he healed others instantly, at a distance, even raised the dead with a word. The gradual process here is intentional.

The placement in Mark's structure is significant. Just before, Jesus asks his disciples, "Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?" They had witnessed the feeding miracles but completely missed the point. Just after, Peter confesses Jesus as the Christ but immediately rebukes him for predicting the crucifixion. He sees who Jesus is but not what kind of Messiah.

The half-healed man functions as a living parable. Partial sight—seeing movement and form but not clarity—mirrors the disciples' condition. They perceive something true about Jesus but lack full understanding.

"Men like trees, walking." He had categories (men, trees) but couldn't properly distinguish. Information was coming in, but interpretation was incomplete. This describes spiritual perception that recognizes something is happening without grasping what it means.

The implication: some seeing requires a second touch. Initial encounter with Jesus produces partial clarity. Full sight comes through continued contact.

## No Formula: The Absence of Method

What emerges from these encounters resists systematization. There is no incantation, no sequence of steps, no ritual that guarantees reception.

The Syrophoenician woman persisted through rejection. The centurion asked Jesus not to come. The father confessed his doubt aloud. The man at Bethesda expressed no faith at all. The blind man at Bethsaida did nothing but submit to being led outside the village. Yet healing came to each—through persistence in one case, through a single request in another, through honest struggle in a third, through sovereign initiative in a fourth, through a two-stage process in a fifth.

If there were a formula, the Pharisees would have mastered it. They had the rules. They had the rituals. They had the heritage and the knowledge and the discipline. What they lacked was the one thing that couldn't be manufactured: a heart that recognized its need and turned toward the one who could meet it.

The rich young ruler followed the commandments from his youth. He did everything right. He came to Jesus with respect, knelt before him, asked the right question. Yet he went away sorrowful because the one thing required of him wasn't on any checklist.

This is why receptivity cannot be reduced to technique. It isn't a posture you adopt or words you recite. The centurion's faith looked like confident authority. The father's faith looked like desperate honesty. The Syrophoenician woman's faith looked like clever persistence. The blind man's faith—if it can be called that—looked like passive submission.

What they shared wasn't method. It was orientation. They were turned toward Jesus rather than toward their own solutions, their own frameworks, their own understanding of how things must work.

The man at Bethesda had a method. Thirty-eight years of method. Get to the pool first when the water stirs. It never worked, but it was a system, and he was committed to it. Jesus stood in front of him offering something entirely outside the system, and the man couldn't see it because he was still explaining why the system had failed him.

Rules produce Pharisees. Formulas produce the pool at Bethesda. What Jesus honors is something harder to define and impossible to fake: a heart that wants him more than it wants a process.

And even then, sovereignty remains. The man at Bethesda had no faith, offered no request, showed no receptivity—and Jesus healed him anyway. Sovereign initiative, unconditioned by human response. God is not a vending machine where correct inputs guarantee outputs. He cannot be manipulated by technique, compelled by ritual, or obligated by our doing things right.

This cuts both ways. Those who approach with genuine faith don't earn healing; they receive it as gift. Those who lack faith aren't necessarily excluded; God remains free to act. The centurion's faith didn't force Jesus' hand. The man at Bethesda's faithlessness didn't tie it.

What receptivity does is position a person to recognize and receive what God freely gives. It doesn't cause the gift. It doesn't deserve the gift. It simply stands with open hands rather than clenched fists or hands too full of other things to receive.

The parable of the sower describes what typically happens—soil condition determines harvest. But the sower remains sovereign over his field. He scatters where he chooses. Good soil doesn't command the seed to fall on it. It simply receives what comes.

Jesus made this point explicitly in his hometown synagogue, and it nearly got him killed. "Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land; but to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."

Two Gentiles. A widow from Sidon and a Syrian military commander. Israel had widows starving and lepers suffering, yet the prophets went outside the covenant people.

The synagogue's response—driving Jesus to a cliff to throw him off—reveals how offensive this truth is. Sovereignty means God isn't obligated to his own people. {% highlight %}Election doesn't create entitlement.{% endhighlight %} Being inside the covenant community doesn't guarantee receiving what the covenant offers. Meanwhile, outsiders with nothing to commend them receive what insiders assume is theirs by right.

This circles back to the Syrophoenician woman and the centurion. They stand in the line of the widow of Zarephath and Naaman. Gentiles who received what Israel presumed upon.

Perhaps the only thing we can truly offer is humility. A broken and contrite heart—the one sacrifice the Psalms say God will not despise.

The Syrophoenician woman accepted the lowest position at the table. The centurion declared himself unworthy. The father admitted he couldn't muster sufficient faith on his own. Even the blind man at Bethsaida submitted to being led by the hand, spit upon, touched—entirely passive, entirely dependent.

The man at Bethesda, for all his years of suffering, never expressed need. He explained his circumstances. He described his obstacles. He narrated his failures. But he never said, "I need you to heal me." Perhaps that's why Jesus asked the question in the first place: Do you want to be made well? The man's answer revealed someone who had ceased to want, who had settled into his condition, who had more identity in his brokenness than desire for wholeness.

The Pharisees couldn't offer humility because they had too much to protect—their knowledge, their status, their system that placed them at the top. The rich young ruler couldn't offer it because his possessions possessed him. Humility requires empty hands, and theirs were full.

This is the paradox: the one thing God asks is the one thing we cannot manufacture or fake. Humility isn't a technique. You cannot perform contrition. The broken heart is either broken or it isn't. And the breaking isn't something we do to ourselves—it's something we allow when we stop defending, stop explaining, stop positioning ourselves as anything other than beggars before a king.

## The Synthesis

Attitude determines altitude. The same word, the same power, the same offer—received differently based on the condition of the one receiving.

Receptivity isn't passive. It pursues understanding like the disciples asking for explanation. It persists through apparent rejection like the Syrophoenician woman. It brings honest struggle rather than pretending like the father crying "help my unbelief." It remains open to having frameworks dismantled rather than defending systems that don't work.

The obstacles to receiving are equally clear: self-satisfaction that doesn't seek, system loyalty that can't imagine alternatives, and partial sight mistaken for full understanding.

The parable of the sower isn't fatalistic. Soil can be cultivated. Rocky ground can be cleared. Thorns can be uprooted. The question Jesus poses to the man at Bethesda remains: Do you want to be made well?

The answer determines everything that follows.
