# The God Who Has Always Been God

*Why Mormon Theology Contradicts Biblical Monotheism*

The question at the heart of any religious system is simple: Who is God? Not what God does, not what God promises, but who God fundamentally is. On this question, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and historic Christianity part ways so completely that they cannot both be describing the same deity.

Mormon theology teaches that God the Father was once a man who lived on another world, died, progressed through stages of exaltation, and eventually became God. Furthermore, faithful Latter-day Saints can follow this same path and become gods themselves, ruling over their own worlds. Lorenzo Snow, the fifth president of the LDS Church, crystallized this doctrine in his famous couplet: "As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become."

This teaching originates most explicitly from Joseph Smith's King Follett Discourse, delivered in 1844, where Smith declared that God "was once a man like us" and that "you have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves." This is not a peripheral teaching or outdated speculation—it remains foundational LDS doctrine.

The Bible, however, presents an entirely different picture of God. And the contradiction is not subtle. It is total.

## The God Who Was Never Formed

Isaiah 43:10 delivers what may be the most devastating verse for LDS theology in all of Scripture:

> "Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me."

Consider the precision of this statement. YHWH says no God was "formed" before him. If the Father progressed from manhood to godhood, then a God was formed. YHWH says no God shall be "after" him. If faithful Mormons can achieve exaltation and become gods, then gods will be formed after him. Isaiah explicitly denies both possibilities in a single breath.

This is not an isolated text. Isaiah returns to this theme repeatedly, as if anticipating that future generations would try to populate the space around YHWH with additional deities:

> "I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God." (Isaiah 44:6)

> "Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any." (Isaiah 44:8)

> "I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me." (Isaiah 45:5)

That phrase in Isaiah 44:8—"I know not any"—carries particular weight. The Hebrew construction (לֹא יָדָעְתִּי, *lo yadati*) functions as a categorical denial. The omniscient God declares he does not recognize, acknowledge, or grant standing to any other deity. The verb יָדַע (*yada*) in Hebrew carries relational and covenantal weight—not mere intellectual awareness but recognition and acknowledgment. (For a fuller treatment of what *yada* means and why it matters, see [What We Don't Know About "Know"](/2026/01/02/yada-knowing-deeper-meaning).) God refuses to grant any other god legitimacy because no other god exists.

If LDS theology were true—if an infinite chain of gods exists, each exalting the next—YHWH would certainly know about them. He would know the god who exalted him. Yet he declares with emphatic finality: I know not any.

## The Problem of Infinite Regress

Mormon theology creates a logical problem it cannot solve. If God the Father was once a man who was exalted to godhood, then he was created by a previous god. And that god was once a man exalted by another god before him. The chain extends backward infinitely.

This raises unavoidable questions: Who was the first god? If there was a first, where did he come from? If there wasn't a first, how did the chain ever get started? You either have an infinite regress of gods with no beginning—which is philosophically incoherent—or you have a first god who came from nothing, which contradicts the entire system.

The Bible cuts through this confusion. When God reveals his name to Moses in Exodus 3:14, he declares "I AM THAT I AM" (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה, *ehyeh asher ehyeh*). This is a declaration of self-existence. He doesn't derive his being from anything prior. He simply is. The name YHWH itself encodes this reality—the self-existent one who depends on nothing and no one for his existence.

Psalm 90:2 reinforces this: "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God." Not "you became God" or "you achieved godhood." You ARE God—from everlasting to everlasting. No beginning, no prior state, no progression.

Malachi 3:6 adds another dimension: "For I am the LORD, I change not." A being who was once a man and became God has, by definition, changed. He changed in nature, in status, in ontological category. Yet YHWH declares immutability as essential to his identity. The LDS God must change to be who he is. The biblical God cannot change and be who he is.

## John's Prologue Closes the Door

The New Testament confirms and extends Old Testament monotheism. John 1:1-3 establishes the framework:

> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."

The logic is airtight. Everything that exists falls into one of two categories: the Creator or the created. There is no third category. If something was made, the Word (the Logos, who is Christ) made it. If the Word didn't make it, it wasn't made—meaning it's eternal and uncreated.

This creates an insurmountable problem for LDS theology. If God the Father was once a man who became God, then at some point he was a created being. But John says everything that was made was made by the Word. So either the Father was made by the Son—which inverts the LDS hierarchy and creates obvious problems—or the Father was never made, which contradicts the King Follett teaching entirely.

The same logic eliminates the progression of gods doctrine. If faithful Mormons can become gods over their own worlds, those future gods would be created beings who later achieved godhood. But John already accounted for everything that was ever made. The category of "beings who weren't made by the Word but later became gods" doesn't exist in John's cosmology.

John 4:24 adds another complication: "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." LDS doctrine teaches that God the Father has a physical body of flesh and bones—a glorified, resurrected body. Jesus says plainly that God is Spirit. These cannot both be true.

## What About "Ye Are Gods"?

LDS apologists sometimes point to John 10:34, where Jesus quotes Psalm 82:6: "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?" This seems to suggest humans can be gods.

But context determines meaning. In Psalm 82, God addresses Israel's corrupt judges. The term "gods" (*elohim*) refers to human rulers acting as God's representatives in judgment—not beings who are ontologically divine or who will become divine. The very next verse proves this: "But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes" (Psalm 82:7). These "gods" are mortal humans facing judgment for their injustice.

Jesus uses this passage to make a lesser-to-greater argument. His point is: "If Scripture can call corrupt human judges 'gods' in a representative sense because they received God's word, how much more appropriate is it for me—the one the Father sanctified and sent into the world—to be called the Son of God?" He's not teaching human deification. He's defending his unique divine identity using rabbinic argumentation.

The irony is that Jesus immediately returns to claiming unity with the Father: "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30). The Jews understood exactly what he meant—they picked up stones to kill him for blasphemy because "thou, being a man, makest thyself God" (John 10:33). Jesus wasn't teaching that all men could become gods. He was claiming a unity with the Father that no mere human could possess.

## Two Different Religions

The point is not that Mormons are insincere or that their moral teachings are deficient. Many Latter-day Saints are deeply devout, family-oriented, and morally serious. The point is that the God they worship is not the God described in Scripture.

Biblical monotheism teaches that YHWH is eternal, uncreated, unchanging, and absolutely unique. There was no god before him, there is no god beside him, and there will be no god after him. He exists as Spirit, not as an exalted physical being. He did not progress to godhood—he has always been God, from everlasting to everlasting.

LDS theology teaches that the Father was once a man, that he progressed through stages to achieve godhood, that multiple gods exist in an eternal chain of exaltation, and that humans can follow the same path. This is not a minor disagreement about church governance or baptismal modes. This is a completely different understanding of ultimate reality.

You don't need to debate the Book of Mormon's historicity, archaeological evidence, or Joseph Smith's character to establish the incompatibility. The doctrine of God alone settles the question. The biblical God and the LDS God cannot both exist. They are mutually exclusive claims about the nature of ultimate reality.

When YHWH declares "I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God," he leaves no room for the LDS cosmology. The space Mormonism needs to populate with an infinite chain of exalted beings is, according to Scripture, absolutely empty. God himself has surveyed it and declared: I know not any.

## The Question That Matters

If you're ever in conversation with a Latter-day Saint, you don't need to become an expert on Mormon history or scripture. You need only ask one question: "Was God always God, or did he used to be a man who became God?"

The answer will reveal everything. Either God has always been God—eternal, self-existent, unchanging—or he hasn't. The Bible is unambiguous on this point. And on this question, everything else depends.

Isaiah spoke truly: "Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me." There is one God. He has always been God. And beside him, there is no other.
