# How to Make Your Woman Look Amazing

There's a phrase you hear in relationship circles: *make your woman feel beautiful*. Good advice, as far as it goes. Compliments matter. Affirmation matters. But Scripture pushes further — not just emotional support, but active involvement in her flourishing.

## More Than a Cheerleader

Ephesians 5:28-29 makes a surprisingly practical argument:

> "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church."

Paul's logic is embodied. Men instinctively care for their own physical wellbeing — feeding, clothing, grooming, protecting. The exhortation extends that same self-care outward to the wife. The Greek words are instructive:

- **Nourisheth** (*ektréphei*) — to feed to fullness, rear to maturity. The same word used for raising children. It implies providing what's needed for growth and flourishing.
- **Cherisheth** (*thálpei*) — to warm, to soften with warmth. Used elsewhere of a nursing mother with her children. Tender, protective care.

This isn't passive provision. It's cultivation.

## The Christ Pattern

The preceding verses reveal the model. Christ's relationship to the church isn't hands-off sponsorship:

> "That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish." (Ephesians 5:26-27)

Notice the active verbs: sanctify, cleanse, present. Christ prepares the bride to be seen, to appear glorious. The "washing of water by the word" suggests active instruction — speaking into her life, shaping through communication. The husband in this model is sculptor, not just patron.

The goal is *presentation*. He's preparing her for display — not as trophy, but as the radiant person she was meant to become.

## Old Testament Echoes

This pattern appears earlier in Scripture:

**Song of Solomon 1:10-11** — The bridegroom says, "We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver." He's actively adorning her, providing ornamentation to enhance her beauty.

**Ezekiel 16:8-14** — God describes His covenant with Israel in bridal terms: "I clothed thee also with broidered work... I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck... and thou wast exceeding beautiful." The husband's lavish adornment makes the bride radiant.

The pattern is consistent: the husband's active investment enables the wife's flourishing and beauty.

## What This Looks Like

This isn't about control or criticism. It's about engaged partnership where the husband invests in his wife's development:

- **Provision** — Ensuring she has what she needs to present herself with dignity
- **Attention** — Noticing the details, celebrating her efforts
- **Input** — Speaking into her life with encouragement and wisdom
- **Development** — Supporting her growth spiritually, practically, even physically

The result? Proverbs 31:23 notes that the excellent wife's husband "is known in the gates." Her flourishing reflects his leadership. The causality runs both directions — she makes him look good, but his investment enabled her excellence.

## The Difference

Making your woman *feel* beautiful is good. Making your woman *look* amazing — actively investing in her flourishing so she becomes the radiant person she's capable of being — that's the biblical vision.

Not control. Not criticism. Covenantal love expressed through tangible investment in her success.

That's how Christ loves the church. That's the model for husbands.
