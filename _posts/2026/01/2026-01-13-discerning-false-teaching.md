# Discerning False Teaching: The Character Test

## Introduction

Every generation faces teachers who claim to offer "new insights" into Scripture—readings that overturn centuries of interpretation, that reveal what the church supposedly got wrong, that finally unlock what the text "really means."

How do you evaluate these claims?

The typical approach is to assess the argument itself: Is it logically coherent? Does it account for the evidence? Does the Greek or Hebrew support it?

These questions matter. But they're not the most reliable filter.

The most reliable filter comes from Scripture itself: the character of God and the nature of man. A coherent God communicates coherently. Fallen humans twist truth for personal advantage. These realities should shape how we evaluate any "new" interpretation—and how we think about who should be teaching us in the first place.

## Part 1: God's Character as Hermeneutical Control

### God Communicates with Purpose

Scripture presents God as intentional, precise, and communicating for a reason. He's not confused, careless, or playing word games with eternal destinies.

"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints." — 1 Corinthians 14:33 (KJV)

This has direct implications for interpretation. If a reading introduces confusion where the text is plain, that reading is suspect—not because we can't handle complexity, but because complexity on matters of salvation contradicts God's revealed character.

### The Virgin Birth Test Case

Isaiah 7:14 prophesies: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son."

Modern scholarship claims this is a mistranslation. The Hebrew word עַלְמָה (*almah*) means "young woman," not necessarily "virgin." Matthew, they argue, misread or misapplied the prophecy.

Apply the character test:

- The entire salvation narrative hinges on the virgin birth
- Matthew cites Isaiah 7:14 as prophetic foundation for this birth
- The Septuagint translators—Jewish scholars centuries before Christ, with no Christian agenda—chose παρθένος (*parthenos*, "virgin") for *almah*
- The New Testament authors treated the Septuagint as authoritative Scripture

Would a God of intelligence allow the central claim of Christianity to rest on a translation error? Would He let His inspired New Testament authors misread His Old Testament prophecy? Would He permit 2,000 years of church history to build on a mistake that modern scholars finally corrected?

The alternative isn't just "the church got it wrong." The alternative is that God communicated ambiguously on a matter of eternal consequence—which contradicts His revealed character.

### The Triune Gospel Pattern

1 Corinthians 15:3-4 presents the gospel in three distinct elements:

"Christ **died** for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was **buried**, and that he **rose again** the third day according to the scriptures."

Paul uses three separate Greek clauses, each introduced by ὅτι ("that"). Each element is presented as distinct and prophetically fulfilled.

Modern scholarship often collapses burial into merely "proof of death"—evidence Jesus really died before He rose. But Paul's grammatical structure treats burial as its own essential element, not a subordinate proof of something else.

This pattern reflects:

- God's triune nature (Father, Son, Spirit working together in redemption)
- Man's tripartite nature (body, soul, spirit all addressed)
- Christ's complete work (sin dealt with in death, death's realm invaded in burial, victory demonstrated in resurrection)

A God who communicates with precision wouldn't include burial as a distinct, prophesied element if it were merely redundant evidence.

### The Simplicity of Salvation

"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." — Romans 10:9 (KJV)

"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." — Romans 10:13 (KJV)

"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." — Acts 16:31 (KJV)

The gospel is presented as accessible. "Whosoever" means whosoever. The thief on the cross understood enough to say "Lord, remember me" and received "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise."

Would a God who desires "all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth" (1 Timothy 2:4) encode salvation requirements in ambiguities that only scholars can navigate?

When teaching introduces complexity that makes the path to salvation unclear, it contradicts the character of the God who said:

"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." — Isaiah 1:18 (KJV)

"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters." — Isaiah 55:1 (KJV)

## Part 2: The Nature of Man — Evaluating the Interpreter

### Cui Bono: Who Benefits?

When someone presents a "new reading" that overturns established interpretation, the first question shouldn't be "Is the argument clever?" but "Who benefits from this conclusion, and what does it cost them to be wrong?"

### Academic Career Incentives

You don't get published, tenure, or conference invitations for confirming what the church has always taught. Novel readings generate citations. "Isaiah really meant virgin all along" doesn't get you into journals. "Isaiah's *almah* has been mistranslated for centuries" does.

The system rewards destabilization. Consensus confirmation is professionally worthless. This doesn't mean every scholar is consciously dishonest—but it does mean the incentive structure favors novelty over accuracy.

### Personal Moral Stakes

When someone argues that Romans 1 doesn't really condemn homosexuality, or that the creation account permits theistic evolution, or that hell isn't really eternal—ask what that conclusion costs them personally.

Usually nothing. Often it removes an uncomfortable demand the text would otherwise make.

This is the pattern Scripture predicts:

"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables." — 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (KJV)

### Pride as Root

"Hath God said?" remains the original hermeneutical move.

The serpent didn't deny Scripture existed—he questioned whether it meant what it plainly said. The appeal was to human autonomy: *you* can determine good and evil, *you* can evaluate God's claims, *your* judgment is the final court.

Modern critical scholarship institutionalizes this posture. The text is placed under human judgment rather than the reverse. "We" determine what's authentic, what's later addition, what's culturally conditioned, what "really" meant.

The scholar becomes authority over the text rather than under it.

### The 1 Corinthians 1-2 Framework

Paul explicitly warns that God's wisdom looks like foolishness to the world's wise:

"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent... hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?" — 1 Corinthians 1:19-20 (KJV)

"But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise." — 1 Corinthians 1:27 (KJV)

This isn't anti-intellectualism. It's a warning that credentials and cleverness don't correlate with spiritual discernment. The "wise and prudent" miss what's revealed to "babes" (Matthew 11:25).

The pattern in Scripture is consistent: religious experts miss what fishermen see. Pharisees strain at gnats. Learned men crucify the Messiah while a thief enters paradise.

## Part 3: Case Studies — Popular Teachers Who Exemplify the Pattern

### Dan McClellan

McClellan is a Mormon with a PhD in biblical studies who has built a large following (~1.4 million across platforms) with his "Data Over Dogma" approach. He claims to compartmentalize his personal faith from his scholarship.

But his conclusions consistently:

- Undermine biblical authority and inspiration
- Support progressive sexual ethics
- Align with Mormon-compatible low Christology
- Soften or eliminate exclusive truth claims

He argues *theopneustos* doesn't mean "God-breathed" but merely "life-giving." He claims the virgin birth prophecy is a mistranslation. He reframes reading Scripture as "negotiation" rather than submission.

Every "critical" conclusion opens a door Mormon theology walks through:

- If the Bible contradicts itself → Mormons say the Bible is corrupted
- If Jesus didn't claim deity → Mormon Jesus isn't eternally God
- If inspiration doesn't mean what we thought → Mormon scriptures can stand alongside the Bible
- If meaning is negotiated → Mormon prophets can override the text

He insists his scholarship is independent of his faith. But the fruit is consistent.

### Bart Ehrman

Ehrman is a former evangelical who became an agnostic. He's built a career on books like "Misquoting Jesus" that sensationalize manuscript variants in the New Testament.

His pattern:

- Present debates as settled when they're not
- Emphasize problems in main text, acknowledge they don't affect doctrine in appendices
- Frame his deconversion as intellectual honesty rather than faith failure
- Build a brand around telling Christians why they should doubt

His own mentor, Bruce Metzger, noted that of 20,000 lines in the Greek New Testament, only about 40 are in doubt—and none affect any cardinal doctrine. Ehrman acknowledges this in scholarly contexts but not in popular books.

His deconversion story *is* his brand. Confirming traditional readings would undermine his entire platform.

### Rob Bell

Bell was a megachurch pastor who pushed progressive boundaries until *Love Wins* broke him from evangelicalism. The book argues for some form of universalism—that hell isn't eternal, that everyone eventually gets saved.

He now operates as a solo influencer with no ecclesiastical accountability.

The pattern:

- Removed uncomfortable doctrine (eternal judgment)
- Left accountability structure (local church, elders)
- Answers to audience metrics, not pastoral oversight
- Can walk away at any time with no consequences

Hell as eternal judgment creates pastoral discomfort. Removing it costs him nothing personally.

## Part 4: The Need for Godly Pastors

### The YouTube "Theologian" Is Not Your Pastor

The teachers in Part 3 share a common thread: they operate outside ecclesiastical accountability. They answer to algorithms, book sales, and subscriber counts—not to a local body, not to elders, not to the sheep they influence.

Scripture's model is different.

### God's Design for Teaching Authority

"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine." — Ephesians 4:11-14 (KJV)

"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them." — Acts 20:28-30 (KJV)

"Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account." — Hebrews 13:17 (KJV)

The emphasis is on:

- Local oversight ("the flock over which")
- Personal accountability ("must give account")
- Protection from wolves ("grievous wolves enter in")
- Stability against false teaching ("no more tossed to and fro")

### What Distinguishes a Godly Pastor from a YouTube Theologian

| YouTube Theologian | Godly Pastor |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Accountable to audience metrics | Accountable to God and local elders |
| Rewards come from novelty and engagement | Rewards come from faithful shepherding |
| No personal knowledge of those influenced | Knows the sheep by name |
| Can walk away at any time | Committed to the flock long-term |
| "Watches for" subscriber growth | "Watches for souls" (Hebrews 13:17) |
| Platform amplifies reach beyond qualification | Sphere limited to actual competence and calling |
| Content optimized for algorithm | Teaching shaped by congregation's actual needs |
| No skin in the game if wrong | Must give account for souls led astray |

### The Danger of Disembodied Teaching

When someone's primary theological input comes from social media rather than local pastoral ministry, they lose:

- **Relational context** — A pastor who knows your life can apply Scripture to your situation; an algorithm cannot
- **Correction in love** — A pastor can confront error personally; a YouTuber never knows you believed wrong
- **Accountability both directions** — You can question your pastor; you cannot question a video
- **Protection from wolves** — A shepherd recognizes threats to *his* flock; an influencer addresses abstract audiences
- **The "one another" commands** — Teaching is meant to happen within community, not consumed in isolation

### The Qualifications Matter

1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 list pastoral qualifications that YouTube metrics cannot measure:

- "Blameless" — Who examines the influencer's private life?
- "Husband of one wife" — Who knows their family situation?
- "Vigilant, sober, of good behaviour" — Who observes their daily conduct?
- "Apt to teach" — Verified by fruitful ministry, not view counts
- "Not greedy of filthy lucre" — Monetization incentives invisible to audience
- "Ruleth well his own house" — Completely unknown to followers
- "Not a novice" — Platform can elevate the unqualified overnight
- "Good report of them which are without" — Local reputation, not parasocial perception

### The Proliferation of False Teaching Argues FOR Pastoral Authority

The solution isn't to abandon online resources—it's to recognize their proper place.

A YouTube video is not a shepherd. A podcast is not an elder. A TikTok theologian cannot watch for your soul.

The church needs men who meet biblical qualifications, who are set apart by local congregations, who know their sheep, who will give account for specific souls entrusted to their care.

"And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding." — Jeremiah 3:15 (KJV)

"Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD... I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed." — Jeremiah 23:1, 4 (KJV)

## Part 5: Framework for Evaluation

When you encounter any teaching—online or in person—ask:

1. **What does this conclusion cost the presenter if wrong?**
   If nothing, be skeptical.

2. **What personal, professional, or moral benefit does it provide them?**
   Novel readings build careers. Confirming tradition doesn't.

3. **Does the reading place human judgment over or under the text?**
   "Hath God said?" is the original hermeneutical error.

4. **Is "new" treated as evidence of insight or evidence of departure?**
   The faith was "once delivered unto the saints" (Jude 3).

5. **Who historically held this view, and why did the church reject it?**
   Most "new" readings are old heresies with fresh marketing.

6. **Would a God of clarity communicate this way?**
   Confusion on salvation matters contradicts His character.

7. **Is this person accountable to a local church body, or only to an audience?**
   Platform reach without pastoral accountability is dangerous.

8. **Do they meet the biblical qualifications for teaching authority?**
   Credentials are not qualifications. Followers are not fruit.

## Conclusion

Discerning false teaching isn't primarily about who has the better argument. It's about understanding God's character (He communicates clearly on essential matters) and man's nature (we twist truth for personal advantage).

Scripture provides the framework:

- God is not the author of confusion
- The gospel is simple enough for "whosoever"
- Men will gather teachers to scratch itching ears
- Wolves will arise, speaking perverse things
- The remedy is godly shepherds who watch for souls

The proliferation of online "theologians" operating outside ecclesiastical accountability isn't an argument against pastoral authority—it's an argument *for* it.

Find a church with qualified elders. Sit under men who know you, who will give account for your soul, who have skin in the game if they lead you astray.

By all means, use online resources. But recognize them for what they are: tools, not shepherds.

"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me." — John 10:27 (KJV)

The Good Shepherd knows His sheep. Make sure your teachers do too.
