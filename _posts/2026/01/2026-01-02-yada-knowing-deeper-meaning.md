# What We Don't Know About "Know"

*Recovering a Word the Modern World Has Flattened*

When modern English speakers encounter the word "know," they hear something almost exclusively cognitive—data retrieval, information storage, mental awareness. You know your phone number. You know the capital of France. You know that two plus two equals four. It's clipboard knowledge, filed away in mental folders, ready for recall.

But the Hebrew word translated "know" throughout Scripture—יָדַע (*yada*)—carries freight that English dropped somewhere along the way. And recovering it changes how we read the Bible.

## The Problem with "Know"

Consider Isaiah 44:8, where God addresses the question of other deities:

> "Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any."

To modern ears, this sounds oddly uncertain. It reads like God scratching his head, trying to remember if there were other gods he'd heard about somewhere. The omniscient Creator of the universe seems to be admitting a gap in his knowledge.

But the Hebrew says something entirely different. When God declares "I know not any" (לֹא יָדָעְתִּי, *lo yadati*), he's not confessing ignorance. He's making a sovereign dismissal. A better paraphrase might be: "I don't espouse the idea of other gods." The verb carries relational and covenantal weight—not mere intellectual awareness but recognition, acknowledgment, the granting of standing. God refuses to grant any supposed deity legitimacy because no other deity exists.

The English word "know" has narrowed drastically. It's now almost exclusively epistemic—relating to information and cognition. The bodily, relational, covenantal dimensions have dropped out of common usage. So translators are stuck: the literal rendering is technically accurate but functionally misleading.

## What Yada Actually Means

Here's a working definition: *Yada* means to engage with something or someone so directly and personally that it becomes part of your lived experience and shapes who you are.

The semantic range runs wide:

At minimum, *yada* means to recognize, acknowledge, or grant standing to something or someone.

At midpoint, it means to engage with, embrace, or make one's own—an idea, a skill, a commitment.

At maximum, it describes the most intimate human act.

The common thread: *yada* is never passive information storage. It always implies encounter. Something has passed between knower and known. The knower is different afterward. Distance has collapsed.

A useful shorthand for teaching: *Yada* is knowing that costs you something—your distance, your detachment, your separateness. It's knowledge that requires showing up, not just looking up.

## Walking Through the Examples

Scripture uses *yada* across a remarkable range of contexts. Examining them reveals the word's depth.

**"Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived" (Genesis 4:1)**

This is the baseline case most people half-remember—the "biblical" euphemism for sexual union. But notice what the word captures: physical union so complete that another person results. Not merely sex but the full giving over of oneself to another. The knowing produces offspring. The knower is permanently changed, now a father. This isn't information transfer; it's union that generates new life.

**"The tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis 2:17, 3:5)**

This one trips up nearly everyone. The tree sounds like it granted Adam and Eve information they didn't already have—as if they were ignorant of moral categories before the Fall. But they already knew God's command. They already knew what was forbidden.

The serpent's promise wasn't "you'll learn about good and evil." It was "you'll know good and evil"—experiential acquisition, personal ownership, internal authorship. To know good and evil the way God knows good: by originating it, not merely observing it.

The tragedy is that humans gained this "knowing" in the wrong direction. They now know evil from the inside as participants, not merely as observers who recognize it. They claimed the authority to define good and evil for themselves. The word *yada* here means to take ownership, to make one's own, to experience personally what was meant to remain external.

**"You only have I known of all the families of the earth" (Amos 3:2)**

God is omniscient. He doesn't lack information about Egypt, Babylon, or Assyria. But Israel alone he *yada*—chose, embraced, covenanted with, committed to. The word carries election weight. To be "known" by God is to be singled out for intimate relationship, claimed as his own.

Which is why the verse continues ominously: "therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." Intimacy brings accountability. The closer the relationship, the higher the standard. *Yada* creates obligation.

**"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee" (Jeremiah 1:5)**

This is not mere foreknowledge—"I was aware you would exist." God had already engaged Jeremiah, set him apart, claimed him. The relationship preceded the biology. *Yada* here is preemptive commitment. Before Jeremiah drew breath, he was known—chosen, embraced, destined for a particular calling. The knowing happened before the being.

**"Depart from me, I never knew you" (Matthew 7:23)**

The Greek word here (*ginosko*) carries the same semantic range as the Hebrew behind it. These are people with impressive spiritual resumes—they prophesied, cast out demons, performed mighty works. Externally, they looked like the real thing.

But Jesus declares that no relationship ever existed. Not "I forgot you" or "I lost track of you"—*I never acknowledged you as mine.* This is covenantal rejection, not memory failure. They called him Lord, but he never called them his. The activity happened outside the relationship entirely.

**"I know not any" (Isaiah 44:8)**

Return to where we started. Given the relational depth *yada* carries everywhere else, God's declaration becomes total non-recognition of supposed rival deities. Not ignorance but categorical refusal to entertain the premise.

The word that describes marital union, covenantal election, and experiential participation also describes God's absolute dismissal of idols. He refuses to grant them standing, recognition, or the dignity of engagement—because there is nothing there to engage.

## The Pattern

Every use of *yada* involves personal engagement that closes distance.

Whether sexual union, covenantal election, experiential participation, or deliberate non-acknowledgment—the word always implies something has happened between knower and known (or pointedly *hasn't*, in Isaiah 44:8). The knower is involved, committed, changed. It's never clipboard knowledge.

This is why "I never knew you" is the most terrifying verdict Jesus could pronounce. It's not that he lacked information about the person. It's that he never engaged them, never embraced them, never made them his own. They existed outside the relationship they thought they had.

And it's why "knowing" God isn't a matter of theological data or doctrinal accuracy. You can know *about* God with perfect precision and still hear "I never knew you." Because *yada* requires encounter, commitment, union—not merely correct information.

## Why This Matters

Modern Western culture has nearly completed the reduction of "knowing" to data management. Knowledge is information, stored and searchable. To know something is to have mental access to facts about it.

But the Bible operates in a different world. To know is to engage, embrace, commit, unite. To know God is to enter covenant relationship, not to compile accurate theological files. To know good and evil is to claim authorship over moral categories, not to receive a moral education. To be known by God is to be chosen, claimed, set apart for relationship.

When we read Scripture with the flattened English sense of "know," we miss most of what's being said. The word that sounds like passive data retrieval actually describes the most active, committed, transformative form of engagement humans can experience.

People don't know what "know" used to mean. And until they do, large portions of Scripture remain obscured behind a word that looks familiar but says something the modern reader no longer hears.

## The Recovery

The fix isn't complicated. When you see "know" in Scripture, ask: What kind of engagement is being described? Is this recognition? Commitment? Union? Experiential participation? Covenantal embrace?

The context will tell you. But the assumption should be that *yada* is never mere cognition. Something is happening between knower and known. Distance is collapsing. Relationship is forming—or being denied.

When God says "I know not any," he's not scratching his head. He's closing the door. There is no engagement, no recognition, no relationship, because there is nothing there to engage.

When Jesus says "I never knew you," he's not checking his memory. He's pronouncing a verdict. The relationship you thought existed never began.

And when Scripture invites you to "know" God, it's not offering theological education. It's offering union—the kind of knowing that costs you your distance, your detachment, your autonomy. The kind where you show up, not just look up.

That's what *yada* means. And now you know.
