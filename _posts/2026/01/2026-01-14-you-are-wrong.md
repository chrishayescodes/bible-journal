# YOU ARE WRONG
## Why Attacks on Scripture Fail — And What's Really Going On

> ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· πλανᾶσθε μὴ εἰδότες τὰς γραφὰς μηδὲ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ θεοῦ

# THE ACCUSATION

You've heard it before. Maybe online, maybe from a friend, maybe in your own head during a dark night:

> "Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a rape victim to marry her rapist. The God of the Bible condones rape."

It sounds devastating. It feels unanswerable. It's presented with the confidence of someone who has finally found the smoking gun that proves the Bible is morally bankrupt and its God a monster.

**There's just one problem: it's completely wrong.**

And not just exegetically wrong — though it is that. It's wrong at a deeper level. It reveals something about the accuser that they don't even realize.

Let me show you both.

---

# PART I: THE EXEGETICAL ANSWER

## What the Text Actually Says

The accusation depends on Deuteronomy 22:28-29. But critics rarely read three verses earlier. Let's look at the whole passage.

### The Rape Case (vv. 25-27)

> "But if the man finds the betrothed woman in the field and **overpowers her** [חָזַק, *chazaq*] and lies with her, then **only the man who lay with her shall die**. But you shall do **nothing to the young woman**; she has committed no sin worthy of death. For this is like when a man attacks his neighbor and **murders him**."

Let that sink in:

- **Penalty:** Death for the rapist
- **Victim:** Explicitly exonerated — "do nothing to her"
- **Comparison:** Rape is likened to **murder**

**If God condones rape, why does He prescribe the death penalty for it and compare it to murder?**

### The Disputed Case (vv. 28-29)

> "If a man finds a virgin who is not betrothed and **seizes her** [תָּפַשׂ, *taphas*] and lies with her, and **they are found**, then the man shall give to the father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife."

Notice anything different?

---

## The Hebrew Verb Distinction

This is the crux of the entire issue:

| Verse | Hebrew Verb | Meaning | Penalty |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| v. 25 (Rape) | **חָזַק** (*chazaq*) | Overpower, force, prevail against | **Death** |
| v. 28 (Disputed) | **תָּפַשׂ** (*taphas*) | Grasp, take hold, seize | Marriage + fine |

These are not the same word. They don't mean the same thing.

**חָזַק** (*chazaq*) means to overpower by superior strength. It's the verb used when Amnon raped Tamar: "He was **stronger** than she, and he **overpowered her** and violated her" (2 Samuel 13:14).

**תָּפַשׂ** (*taphas*) means to grasp or take hold. It's used for handling a harp (Genesis 4:21), capturing a city (Deuteronomy 20:19), or arresting someone (Jeremiah 37:13). Physical? Yes. Forcible overpowering? No.

**The author knew how to say "rape." He just said it in v. 25.** The switch to a different verb in v. 28 signals a different act.

---

## The Exodus Parallel

Still not convinced? Look at the parallel law in Exodus:

> "If a man **seduces** [פָּתָה, *patah*] a virgin who is not betrothed and lies with her, he shall pay the bride-price for her to be his wife." (Exodus 22:16)

Same situation: unbetrothed virgin.
Same penalty: marriage + payment.
Clear verb: **פָּתָה** — seduce. Unambiguously consensual.

**Same case, same penalty, clear vocabulary.** Deuteronomy 22:28-29 is the seduction law, not a rape law.

---

## The Plural Discovery Clause

One more detail critics miss. Verse 28 says:

> "...and lies with her **and they are found**" (וְנִמְצָאוּ, *venimtseʾu*)

The verb is **plural** — "they are found," not "he is found."

In a rape, the attacker flees. The victim is found alone, traumatized. Here, **both** are discovered together.

This is consistent with a consensual encounter, not a violent assault.

---

## The Missing Markers

Compare what's present in the rape case versus the disputed case:

| Marker | v. 25-27 (Rape) | v. 28-29 (Disputed) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Force verb (חָזַק) | ✓ Present | ✗ Absent |
| "She cried out" | ✓ Present | ✗ Absent |
| Victim exonerated | ✓ Explicit | ✗ Absent |
| Compared to murder | ✓ Present | ✗ Absent |
| Death penalty | ✓ Yes | ✗ No |
| Discovery | Him alone (implied) | **They** (plural) |

**If vv. 28-29 described rape, why are all the rape markers absent?**

---

## The Verdict

Basic exegesis — just reading the Hebrew carefully — dismantles the accusation:

1. **Different verbs:** חָזַק (overpower) vs. תָּפַשׂ (grasp)
2. **Different penalties:** Death vs. marriage
3. **Exodus parallel:** Same case, uses "seduce"
4. **Plural discovery:** Both found together
5. **Missing markers:** No force verb, no exoneration, no murder comparison

**The text distinguishes rape from seduction. Rape gets death. The disputed passage isn't about rape.**

Accusation dismantled.

---

# PART II: BUT THAT'S NOT THE REAL PROBLEM

## The Deeper Issue

Here's what I've learned after years of these conversations:

**You can win the exegetical argument and change nothing.**

Because the person who makes this accusation will just find another "problem text." Leviticus 25. Numbers 31. Judges 19. The conquest narratives. They'll keep hunting.

Why?

Because the real problem isn't Deuteronomy 22. **The real problem is their posture before God.**

They are sitting in judgment on the Almighty. They are evaluating whether God meets their moral standards. They have appointed themselves the arbiter of good and evil, and they're grading God's performance.

**That's not an exegetical error. That's a spiritual catastrophe.**

---

## The Two-Level Problem

| Level | Problem | What It Looks Like |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Level 1: Exegetical** | They misread the text | Wrong on Hebrew, context, parallels |
| **Level 2: Spiritual** | They have no fear of God | Sitting in judgment on the Almighty |

Level 1 is fixable with study. Show them the data, and an honest person can see they misread the text.

Level 2 is not fixable with study. This requires something study cannot provide.

**Level 1 errors are symptoms. Level 2 is the disease.**

You can correct Level 1 all day long. But if Level 2 remains, they'll just find another "problem" — because the problem is in them, not the text.

---

# PART III: WHAT'S ACTUALLY MISSING

## They Don't Know the Scriptures

Jesus told the Sadducees: "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."

The first deficiency: **they don't know the Scriptures**.

This isn't about having *read* them. The Sadducees had read them. They studied professionally. They could quote chapter and verse.

But they didn't **know** them:

| Having Read | Actually Knowing |
|-------------|------------------|
| Familiar with words | Understanding the meaning |
| Can cite verses | Can trace themes |
| Knows isolated texts | Sees canonical unity |
| Surface reading | Depth comprehension |
| Piecemeal | Comprehensive |

The modern critic can quote Deuteronomy 22:28-29. But they:

- Don't know the Hebrew verbs
- Don't see the case law structure
- Don't connect it to Exodus 22:16-17
- Don't understand the ANE context
- Don't grasp what Deuteronomy is
- Don't trace sexuality across the canon

**They have words without understanding. That's not knowing Scripture.**

---

## They Don't Know the Power of God

The second deficiency is deeper: **they don't know the power of God**.

This means they have a **small God** — too small to be sovereign, too small to define morality, too small to be feared.

| Their Assumption | The Power of God |
|------------------|------------------|
| God can be judged by human standards | God **sets** the standard |
| God must answer to me | I must answer to God |
| God's ways should make sense to me | "My ways are higher than your ways" (Isaiah 55:9) |
| If I don't approve, God is wrong | If I don't approve, I am blind |

**They don't know who they're dealing with.**

---

## The Audacity of the Accusation

Consider what the critic is actually claiming:

> "I, a finite creature with 70-odd years of existence, limited knowledge, corrupted reasoning, and no access to ultimate truth, have determined that the infinite, eternal, omniscient Creator of the universe is **morally deficient** — and I will sit in judgment on Him."

This isn't intellectual courage. It's cosmic arrogance.

> "Woe to him who strives with Him who formed him, a pot among earthen pots! Does the clay say to him who forms it, 'What are you making?'" (Isaiah 45:9)

---

# PART IV: THE FEAR THEY'VE NEVER KNOWN

## Who God Actually Is

The critic relates to God as a **concept** — an idea to evaluate, a hypothesis to test, a position to critique.

But the God of Scripture is not encountered as a concept. He is encountered as **overwhelming, terrifying, life-altering Reality**.

### Holy — Utterly Set Apart

> "**Holy, holy, holy** is YHWH of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory." (Isaiah 6:3)

Isaiah's response? "**Woe is me! I am undone!** For I am a man of unclean lips."

The prophet — a righteous man — sees God and expects to die.

### Consuming Fire

> "For YHWH your God is a **consuming fire**, a jealous God." (Deuteronomy 4:24)

> "For our God is a **consuming fire**." (Hebrews 12:29)

Same description. Old Testament and New. **Same God.**

### Terrifying in Power

At Sinai:

> "And all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, and when the people saw it, **they trembled** and stood far off. And they said to Moses, 'You speak to us... but **do not let God speak to us, lest we die**.'" (Exodus 20:18-19)

Two million people begged for it to stop. They didn't debate whether God's laws were fair. They **trembled and feared death**.

---

## What Happens When Men Meet God

| Person | Status | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Isaiah** | Prophet | "I am undone!" — expects death |
| **Ezekiel** | Prophet | Falls on his face |
| **Daniel** | Prophet | Loses all strength, falls comatose |
| **John** | Apostle who knew Jesus | Falls at His feet **as a dead man** |
| **Israel** | Covenant people | Tremble, beg for distance |
| **Priests** | Trained ministers | Cannot stand when glory fills the temple |

**This is what happens when finite creatures encounter the infinite God.**

---

## The Modern Contrast

Now consider the modern critic:

| The Prophets | The Modern Critic |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Fall prostrate | Sits in judgment |
| Lose all strength | Musters arguments |
| Expect death | Expects answers |
| Tremble | Smirks |
| Beg for distance | Demands explanation |
| "Woe is me!" | "How dare God..." |

**The difference is absolute.**

The prophets had **encountered** God. The critic has only **conceived** of God — and poorly.

They are theologizing about Someone they have never met. It's like a man born blind critiquing the colors of a sunset. He has opinions — but no experience. And his opinions reveal only his blindness.

---

## The Fear of the Lord

Scripture commands what modernity has lost:

> "The **fear of YHWH** is the beginning of wisdom." (Proverbs 9:10)

> "The **fear of YHWH** is the beginning of knowledge." (Proverbs 1:7)

This isn't optional. This isn't one approach among many. **Fear of the Lord is the prerequisite for understanding anything.**

Without it:

- Wisdom is impossible
- Knowledge is distorted
- Scripture is misread
- God becomes a defendant

**The fear of the Lord is the interpretive key that unlocks everything.**

---

# PART V: WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY MISSING ABOUT GOD

## The God They Don't Know

The critic attacks the Law as harsh. But they don't understand what they're looking at.

### A Holy God Showing Restraint

If God operated on pure holiness without mercy, the Law could say:

| Offense | "Pure Holiness" Response |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Any sexual sin | Death — all deviation defiles |
| Any sin whatsoever | Immediate destruction |
| Seduction | Death |
| Even the seduced | Death — she participated |

A holy God would be **just** to demand death for any violation. That's what holiness means.

### What God Actually Provides

| Offense | What Holiness Could Demand | What God Provides |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Seduction | Death | Marriage + fine + no divorce |
| Unintentional sin | Death | Sacrifice and restoration |
| Rape victim | Suspicion / blame | **Explicit exoneration** |
| The seducer | Death | A path to make it right |

**The Law isn't harsh. It's holiness tempered by extraordinary mercy.**

---

## The ANE Context They Ignore

Critics attack Israel's laws while ignoring what surrounded them.

### What the Neighbors Did

| Culture | Practice |
|---------|----------|
| **Mesopotamia** | Women required to serve as temple prostitutes |
| **Canaan** | Cult prostitution at Baal shrines |
| **Babylon** | Every woman required to prostitute herself once at the temple |
| **Assyria** | Mass rape as military policy |
| **Various** | Rape victims blamed, punished, killed |

### What Israel's Law Said

| Issue | Surrounding Cultures | Israel's Law |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Temple prostitution | Required | Absolutely forbidden |
| Captured women | Raped immediately | Month of mourning first |
| Rape victims | Blamed, killed | **Explicitly exonerated** |
| Rape penalty | Fines; victim punished | **Death penalty** for rapist |

**Israel's laws were radically protective compared to everything around them.**

---

## The Egyptian Deprogramming They Miss

Israel had just spent 400 years in Egypt. They were Hebrews by blood but **Egyptians by culture**.

The Law makes sense as **systematic deprogramming**:

| Egyptian Assumption | Torah Correction |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Pharaoh is god | YHWH alone is God |
| Sexuality is religious | Sex belongs in covenant marriage |
| Slaves are property | Slaves have rights; release in year 7 |
| Power takes what it wants | Rape = death; the powerful are accountable |
| Women are commodities | Victims exonerated; women protected |

**The Law isn't primitive. It's revolutionary.**

---

## The Graduated Mercy They Can't See

The Law's penalty structure reveals God's moral reasoning:

| Offense | Aggravating Factors | Penalty |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Rape | Force + violation of person | Death |
| Adultery | Covenant treachery | Death |
| Seduction | Outside covenant — but mutual | Marriage + fine |

**Lesser penalty doesn't mean approval. It means proportional justice.**

The seduction law doesn't say "this is fine." It says:

- You violated God's design
- You will pay a price
- You will take permanent responsibility
- You may never divorce her
- **But you get to live**

That's mercy. From a God who could justly demand death for any deviation from holiness.

---

# PART VI: THE COMPLETE DIAGNOSIS

## Jesus' Rebuke Applied

> "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."

### They Don't Know the Scriptures:

- Don't know the Hebrew verbs
- Don't know the Exodus parallel
- Don't know the case law structure
- Don't know the ANE context
- Don't know what Deuteronomy is
- Don't know the canonical witness

### They Don't Know the Power of God:

- Don't know His holiness (any sin deserves death)
- Don't know His mercy (graduated penalties are restraint)
- Don't know His sovereignty (He defines good and evil)
- Don't know His justice (proportional penalties reflect moral reasoning)
- Don't know His protectiveness (victims are explicitly exonerated)
- **Don't fear Him** (they presume to sit in judgment)

**The diagnosis is total. The blindness is complete.**

---

## The Two-Level Response

### Level 1: Dismantle the Exegesis

> "You've misread the text. The Hebrew uses two different verbs. The rape case is vv. 25-27 with the death penalty. The disputed passage uses a different verb and parallels the seduction law in Exodus 22. Here's the evidence..."

**This removes the specific objection.**

### Level 2: Expose the Deeper Problem

> "But here's the real issue: your posture is wrong. You're sitting in judgment on the Almighty. The prophets who actually encountered God fell as dead men — and you're critiquing His ethics? You don't know the Scriptures. You don't know the power of God. And until you do, you'll keep finding 'problems' — because the problem is in you, not the text."

**This addresses the root.**

---

# PART VII: THE DEVASTATING REALITY

## What They Don't Grasp

> "It is a **fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God**." (Hebrews 10:31)

The God they mock is the God they will face. The judgment they pronounce on Him will be reversed — and they will stand before the **consuming fire** with no defense.

This isn't a debate. It isn't an intellectual exercise. It's **eternal reality**.

The mountain is still burning. The glory hasn't faded. The Holy One hasn't changed.

The only thing missing is eyes to see.

---

## The Invitation

This is ultimately an invitation — not to win an argument, but to **encounter God**:

> "You could stop standing in judgment and fall before the Judge. You could stop critiquing and start trembling. You could meet the One you've been mocking — and discover that He is not what you thought, and you are not what you thought, and everything changes when the Holy One enters the room."

That's the paradigm shift. From concept to encounter. From evaluation to prostration. From critic to worshiper.

**And when that happens, Deuteronomy 22 isn't a problem anymore. It's just one more facet of a God too great to comprehend and too holy to question.**

---

# CONCLUSION: THE JOB SOLUTION

## The Man Who Argued With God

There's a man in Scripture who did what the modern critic does. He questioned God. He challenged God's justice. He demanded answers. He argued his case for **37 chapters**.

His name was Job.

> "I would speak to the Almighty, and **I desire to argue my case with God**." (Job 13:3)

> "Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my signature! **Let the Almighty answer me!**" (Job 31:35)

Job had complaints. Legitimate ones. He had lost everything — children, wealth, health. He sat in ashes scraping his sores. And he wanted answers.

For chapter after chapter, Job made his case. His friends offered bad theology. Job rejected it. He maintained his innocence. He demanded an audience with the Almighty.

**And then God showed up.**

---

## The Encounter That Changed Everything

> וַיַּעַן־יְהוָה אֶת־אִיּוֹב מִן הַסְּעָרָה וַיֹּאמַר מִי זֶה מַחְשִׁיךְ עֵצָה בְמִלִּין בְּלִי־דָעַת
>
> "Then YHWH answered Job **out of the whirlwind** and said: 'Who is this that darkens counsel by **words without knowledge**?'" (Job 38:1-2)

God didn't answer Job's questions.

He didn't explain the suffering. He didn't justify His decisions. He didn't submit to Job's courtroom.

Instead, He asked questions of His own:

> "**Where were you** when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding." (Job 38:4)

> "Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place?" (Job 38:12)

> "Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion?" (Job 38:31)

> "Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, **let him answer it**." (Job 40:2)

For four chapters, God revealed Himself — His power, His wisdom, His sovereignty over creation. Not answers to Job's questions, but **revelation of who was asking and who was being asked**.

---

## Job's Response

And what did Job say?

> הֵן קַלֹּתִי מָה אֲשִׁיבֶךָּ יָדִי שַׂמְתִּי לְמוֹ־פִי
>
> "Behold, **I am of small account**. What shall I answer you? **I lay my hand over my mouth**." (Job 40:4)

And again:

> לְשֵׁמַע־אֹזֶן שְׁמַעְתִּיךָ וְעַתָּה עֵינִי רָאָתְךָ עַל־כֵּן אֶמְאַס וְנִחַמְתִּי עַל־עָפָר וָאֵפֶר
>
> "I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now **my eye sees you**. Therefore I **despise myself** and **repent in dust and ashes**." (Job 42:5-6)

---

## What Changed?

Job's circumstances didn't change — not yet. His questions weren't answered. His children were still dead. His body was still broken.

But **Job** changed.

| Before the Encounter | After the Encounter |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| "I desire to argue my case" | "I lay my hand over my mouth" |
| Demanded answers | Repented in dust |
| Heard of God by hearing | **Saw God with his eyes** |
| Words, words, words | Silence |

**The questions didn't get answered. They became irrelevant.**

When Job actually encountered God, the questions dissolved. The Questioner was so overwhelming that the questions no longer mattered.

This is what the modern critic needs. Not better arguments. Not more exegesis. Not a winning debate.

**They need to see God.**

---

## The Difference Between Hearing and Seeing

Job said it perfectly:

> "I had **heard** of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my **eye sees** you."

There are two ways to know about God:

| Hearing | Seeing |
|---------|--------|
| Secondhand knowledge | Direct encounter |
| Information about God | Experience of God |
| Theology as concept | Theology as reality |
| Words | Presence |
| Debate | Worship |

The critic has *heard* of God. They've heard enough to form opinions, construct arguments, level accusations.

But they have never **seen** Him.

And until they do, they will remain — as Jesus said — deceived, knowing neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.

---

## The Call

This is the call — not to win arguments, but to seek encounter:

> דִּרְשׁוּ יְהוָה בְּהִמָּצְאוֹ קְרָאֻהוּ בִּהְיוֹתוֹ קָרוֹב
>
> "**Seek YHWH while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.**" (Isaiah 55:6)

There is a window. There is a "while." God is near — but He will not always be near. He may be found — but He will not always be found.

The invitation is open. But it will not remain open forever.

---

## What Seeking Looks Like

To the critic, to the skeptic, to the one with questions and accusations:

**Stop arguing. Start seeking.**

- Not seeking answers — seeking **Him**
- Not seeking to win — seeking to **know**
- Not demanding explanation — asking for **revelation**

> "You will seek me and find me, **when you seek me with all your heart**." (Jeremiah 29:13)

The promise is real. God can be found. But not by those who stand in judgment. Only by those who fall on their faces.

Job found Him. Isaiah found Him. Ezekiel, Daniel, John — they all found Him.

And when they did, they stopped talking.

---

## The Final Word

Basic exegesis dismantles the accusation against Deuteronomy 22.

But the deeper problem isn't exegetical. It's experiential. **They have never encountered the living God.**

Job complained for 37 chapters. Then God showed up, and Job put his hand over his mouth and repented in dust and ashes.

That's what's needed. Not more arguments. **An encounter.**

The God who spoke from the whirlwind is still speaking. The Holy One who revealed Himself to Job, to Isaiah, to the trembling masses at Sinai — He can still be found.

But not for long. Not forever.

> **"Seek YHWH while He may be found."**

The whirlwind is coming for everyone. The question is whether you'll meet Him as Judge or as Redeemer.

Seek His face.

While He may be found.

---

*Soli Deo Gloria*
