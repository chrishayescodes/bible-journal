# Exploring 1 Corinthians 15: The Resurrection Chapter
## A Study Using the King James Version and Textus Receptus

**CH:** Using KJV and Textus Receptus, let's explore 1 Corinthians 15.

**Assistant:** I'd be happy to explore 1 Corinthians 15 with you using the King James Version and referencing the Textus Receptus tradition. This is one of the most theologically significant chapters in the New Testament, often called "The Resurrection Chapter."

1 Corinthians 15 contains Paul's extended discourse on the resurrection of Christ and the promise of resurrection for believers. The chapter can be divided into several key sections:

**The Gospel Foundation (verses 1-11)** - Paul reminds the Corinthians of the gospel he preached, emphasizing Christ's death for sins, burial, and resurrection on the third day "according to the scriptures." He lists the witnesses to the resurrection, including the twelve, over 500 brethren at once, James, and finally himself.

**The Necessity of Resurrection (verses 12-34)** - Paul addresses those who deny the resurrection, arguing that if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not risen, making their faith vain and leaving them still in their sins. This section contains the famous verse 22: "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."

**The Nature of the Resurrection Body (verses 35-58)** - Paul explains how the dead are raised and what kind of body they will have, using analogies from nature. He distinguishes between the natural body that is sown and the spiritual body that is raised, concluding with the triumphant declaration: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"

## Section 1: The Gospel Foundation (verses 1-11)

**CH:** Let's go over each section iteratively, starting with gospel foundation.

**Assistant:** Excellent! Let's examine the Gospel Foundation section (1 Corinthians 15:1-11) carefully.

### The Gospel Reminder (verses 1-2)
Paul opens by reminding the Corinthians of the gospel he preached to them, which they received, wherein they stand, and by which they are saved - "if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain." This establishes the gospel as both the foundation of their faith and the means of their ongoing salvation.

### The Core Gospel Content (verses 3-4)
Paul declares what he received and delivered as "of first importance":
- "Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures"
- "And that he was buried"
- "And that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures"

The phrase "according to the scriptures" appears twice, emphasizing that Christ's death and resurrection fulfill Old Testament prophecies. The Textus Receptus preserves the perfect tense verbs here, indicating completed actions with ongoing significance.

### The Resurrection Witnesses (verses 5-8)
Paul provides a careful list of witnesses:
- Cephas (Peter)
- The twelve
- Over 500 brethren at once (most still living when Paul wrote)
- James
- All the apostles
- Paul himself ("as of one born out of due time")

This systematic presentation serves as legal testimony to establish the historical reality of the resurrection.

### Paul's Apostolic Defense (verses 9-11)
Paul acknowledges his past persecution of the church but affirms that by God's grace he became an apostle and labored more abundantly than the others - yet clarifies "not I, but the grace of God which was with me."

## Section 2: The Necessity of Resurrection (verses 12-34)

**CH:** 12-34

**Assistant:** Now let's examine the second section: The Necessity of Resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:12-34).

### The Problem at Corinth (verse 12)
Paul addresses the core issue: "Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?" Some Corinthians apparently accepted Christ's resurrection but denied a general resurrection of believers.

### The Logical Consequences (verses 13-19)
Paul presents a devastating logical argument through a series of conditional statements:
- If there's no resurrection of the dead, then Christ isn't risen
- If Christ isn't risen, then apostolic preaching is vain
- If Christ isn't risen, then their faith is vain
- If Christ isn't risen, the apostles are false witnesses of God
- If Christ isn't risen, they're still in their sins
- If Christ isn't risen, the dead in Christ have perished
- If their hope in Christ is only for this life, "we are of all men most miserable"

### The Victory Declared (verses 20-28)
Paul counters with triumphant affirmation: "But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept." He develops the Adam-Christ parallel:

Verse 22: "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive"

He outlines the order: Christ the firstfruits, then those who are Christ's at His coming. The ultimate goal: that God may be "all in all"

### Practical Arguments (verses 29-34)
Paul appeals to practical considerations:
- Why are people baptized for the dead if there's no resurrection?
- Why does Paul face daily dangers and die daily if there's no hope beyond this life?
- His reference to fighting "beasts at Ephesus" (whether literal or metaphorical)
- The warning against the Epicurean philosophy: "Let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die"
- The stern rebuke: "Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God"

## Section 3: The Nature of the Resurrection Body (verses 35-58)

**CH:** 35-58

**Assistant:** Now let's examine the final section: The Nature of the Resurrection Body (1 Corinthians 15:35-58).

### The Questions Posed (verse 35)
Paul anticipates objections: "But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?" These are fundamental questions about the mechanics and nature of resurrection.

### The Seed Analogy (verses 36-38)
Paul uses agricultural imagery: "Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die." The seed must die to produce new life, and what grows differs from what was planted. God gives each seed "its own body" - establishing the principle of continuity with transformation.

### The Diversity in Creation (verses 39-41)
Paul points to the variety God has already created:
- Different flesh: men, beasts, fishes, birds
- Different celestial bodies: sun, moon, stars (each star differing in glory)

This demonstrates God's ability to create different types of bodies suited to different realms.

### The Resurrection Contrasts (verses 42-44)
Paul presents four key contrasts for the resurrection body:
- **Corruption vs. Incorruption:** "It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption"
- **Dishonor vs. Glory:** "It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory"
- **Weakness vs. Power:** "It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power"
- **Natural vs. Spiritual:** "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body"

### The Two Adams (verses 45-49)
Paul develops the Adam-Christ typology further:
- The first Adam became "a living soul"
- The last Adam became "a quickening spirit"
- The natural comes first, then the spiritual
- As we have borne the image of the earthy (Adam), we shall bear the image of the heavenly (Christ)

### The Mystery Revealed (verses 50-57)
Paul declares a "mystery":
- Flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom
- Not all will sleep (die), but all will be changed
- This change happens "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump"
- The dead are raised incorruptible, the living are changed
- Death is swallowed up in victory

### The Triumphant Conclusion (verse 58)
"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."

The word "therefore" connects all the theological truth to practical Christian living. Since resurrection is certain, believers should be unwavering in their service.

## Three Outstanding Verses

**CH:** Give me 3 outstanding verses in this chapter.

**Assistant:** Here are the three outstanding verses with supporting Scripture references:

### 1 Corinthians 15:22 (KJV)
> "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."

**Supporting Scriptures:**
- **Romans 5:12** - "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned"

- **John 11:25** - "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live"
- **Romans 6:23** - "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord"

### 1 Corinthians 15:55 (KJV)
> "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"

**Supporting Scriptures:**
- **Hosea 13:14** - "I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction"

- **2 Timothy 1:10** - "But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel"
- **Hebrews 2:14-15** - "That through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage"

### 1 Corinthians 15:58 (KJV)
> "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."

**Supporting Scriptures:**
- **Galatians 6:9** - "And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not"
- **Ephesians 6:13** - "Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand"
- **Philippians 1:6** - "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ"
- **1 Thessalonians 4:16-17** - "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout... Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds"

These supporting passages show how Paul's resurrection theology in 1 Corinthians 15 connects with the broader biblical narrative of redemption, victory, and hope.
