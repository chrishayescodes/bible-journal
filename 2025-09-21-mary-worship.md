## Catholic Practices Directed Toward Mary That Match Biblical Worship Behaviors:

**Physical Postures and Gestures:**
• **Kneeling before Mary's statues/images** - Catholics are encouraged to kneel before images of the Blessed Mother while praying the Rosary, and some Catholics kneel in front of statues depicting the Virgin Mary - **KJV parallel**: Acts 10:25 "fell down at his feet, and worshipped him"

• **Prostration before Mary** - Sister Lucia prostrated herself while making prayers to Mary during her mystical revelations, "lying prostrate" and "with my arms in the form of a cross" - **KJV parallel**: Revelation 22:8 "I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel"

• **Veneration of Mary's images** - The tradition of honoring Mary by venerating images goes back to 3rd-century Christianity, with "respectful veneration" paid to sacred images - **KJV parallel**: Exodus 20:5 regarding bowing to images

**Prayer and Invocation:**
• **Direct prayers to Mary** - The Rosary includes repeated "Hail Mary" prayers directed to Mary, and the Litany includes titles like "Holy Mother of God, pray for us" - **KJV parallel**: 1 Timothy 2:5 "one mediator between God and men"

• **Seeking Mary's intercession** - Catholics believe Mary intercedes with her Son Jesus, and many find it easier to talk to her than to God directly - **KJV parallel**: John 14:6 "no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"

**Titles and Honors:**
• **"Queen of Heaven" title** - Catholics call Mary the "Queen of Heaven," and she is seen as "Queen and Ruler of the Universe" - **KJV parallel**: Jeremiah 7:18 condemning worship of "queen of heaven"

• **Co-redemptrix and Mediatrix** - Some Catholic teachings refer to Mary as "Co-Redemptrix, Advocate and Mediatrix" - **KJV parallel**: 1 Timothy 2:5 "one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"

**Devotional Practices:**
• **Consecration to Mary** - Formal prayers consecrating oneself "to thine Immaculate Heart" and entrusting "all that I have, all that I am, to thy blessed charge" - **KJV parallel**: Romans 12:1 presenting bodies as living sacrifice to God

• **Wearing devotional items** - Catholics wear scapulars and maintain "Mary gardens" as acts of devotion - **KJV parallel**: Deuteronomy 6:8 regarding wearing God's words

**Catholic Distinction Claims:**
The Catholic Church claims to distinguish between "latria" (worship due to God alone), "dulia" (veneration of saints), and "hyperdulia" (special veneration due to Mary), insisting they "do not worship Mary" but rather "venerate" her.

However, many of these practices - particularly kneeling, prostration, direct prayer, and use of intercessory titles - directly parallel the biblical behaviors attributed to worship (proskuneo) that we identified earlier, which angels, apostles, and other biblical figures consistently refused when offered to them.
